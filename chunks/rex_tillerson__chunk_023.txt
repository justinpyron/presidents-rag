ed on May 17, 2018, making her the first female CIA director.[66] Tillerson's total time in office was 423 days, making him the shortest-serving secretary of state since Lawrence Eagleburger (1992â€“1993). The last time a president's first appointee to the position served for less time was in 1898, when John Sherman left office after 413 days.[76] Tillerson is also the only secretary of state since at least 1945 to have been fired.[77]
In December 2018, President Trump called Tillerson "dumb as a rock" and "lazy as hell" after Tillerson held a speech where he described Trump as "pretty undisciplined". Trump made similar remarks again in May 2019 after Tillerson reportedly said Trump had been outmaneuvered in a meeting with Vladimir Putin.[78] Trump had previously lauded Tillerson, describing him as "one of the truly great business leaders of the world" and a "world class player and dealmaker".[79][80]
Assessments of tenure
In March 2017, Robert Jervis of Columbia University wrote that Tillerson "had little impact on the Trump administration so far" and that his influence would continue to wane.[81] That same month, William Inboden of the University of Texas at Austin defended Tillerson, saying he deserves more time.[82] Daniel W. Drezner of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University was highly critical of Tillerson, calling him an "unmitigated disaster",[83][84] and "the most incompetent Secretary of State in modern history".[85] Elliot Cohen of Johns Hopkins
