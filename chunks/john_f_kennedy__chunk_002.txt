 In April 1931, he had an appendectomy, after which he withdrew from Canterbury and recuperated at home.[16]
In September 1931, Kennedy started attending Choate, a preparatory boarding school in Wallingford, Connecticut.[17] Rose had wanted John and Joe Jr. to attend a Catholic school, but Joe Sr. thought that if they were to compete in the political world, they needed to be with boys from prominent Protestant families.[18] John spent his first years at Choate in his older brother's shadow and compensated with rebellious behavior that attracted a clique. Their most notorious stunt was exploding a toilet seat with a firecracker. In the next chapel assembly, the headmaster, George St. John, brandished the toilet seat and spoke of "muckers" who would "spit in our sea," leading Kennedy to name his group "The Muckers Club," which included roommate and lifelong friend Lem Billings.[19][20] Kennedy graduated from Choate in June 1935, finishing 64th of 112 students.[11] He had been the business manager of the school yearbook and was voted the "most likely to succeed."[19]
