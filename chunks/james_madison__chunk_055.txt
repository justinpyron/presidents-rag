nt out that Madison's loyalty was to the Constitution, not to his personal preferences.  Madison had advocated in the debates of the Constitutional Convention that the proposed federal government have veto power over state laws, but he was willing to follow the Constitution as it was adopted and ratified, rather than what he might have wished that it said.  Madison had written in Federalist #45 that the proposed federal government would have powers that were "few and defined" (as enumerated in Article I of the Constitution).  He felt strongly that to interpret it otherwise would be a breach of faith with "We the People" who had ratified the Constitution based on that understanding.[4][5][6][7][8][9]
Madison, who was the author of the Bill of Rights, was also faithfully following the 10th Amendment, which says that all "powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."[10][11][12][13]
Religion
Although baptized as an Anglican and educated by Presbyterian clergymen,[14] young Madison was an avid reader of English deist tracts.[15] As an adult, Madison paid little attention to religious matters. Though most historians have found little indication of his religious leanings after he left college,[16] some scholars indicate he leaned toward deism.[17][18] Others maintain that Madison accepted Christian tenets and formed his outlook on life with a Christian worldview.[19] Reg
