In July 2024, Obama expressed concerns about Biden's campaign viability after his critically maligned debate performance against former president Trump.[41] On July 21, Biden withdrew his candidacy and swiftly endorsed Vice President Harris right after to run as the Democratic nominee. Obama endorsed Harris alongside his wife Michelle five days later and delivered a critically acclaimed speech at the 2024 Democratic National Convention formally endorsing her.[42] He joined Harris on the campaign trail in October, traveling to various swing states and emphasizing her record as a prosecutor, Senator, and Vice President and advocating for increased voter turnout, and his criticisms of Donald Trump and the Republican Party were widely reported by various media outlets.[43][44] After Trump was declared the winner of the election on November 6, Obama and Michelle congratulated him and Vice President-elect JD Vance while praising the Harris campaign and calling on liberal voters to continue supporting democracy and human rights.[45]
Legacy and recognition
Obama has been described as one of the most effective campaigners in American history (his 2008 campaign being particularly highlighted) as well as one of the most talented political orators of the 21st century.[1][2][3] Historian Julian Zelizer credits Obama with "a keen sense of how the institutions of government work and the ways that his team could design policy proposals."
