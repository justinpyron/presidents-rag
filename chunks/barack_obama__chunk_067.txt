 rating fell to 38 percent on several occasions in late 2011[14] before recovering in mid-2012 with polls showing an average approval of 50 percent.[15] After his second inauguration in 2013, Obama's approval ratings remained stable around 52 percent[16] before declining for the rest of the year and eventually bottoming out at 39 percent in December.[11] In polling conducted before the 2014 midterm elections, Obama's approval ratings were at their lowest[17][18] with his disapproval rating reaching a high of 57 percent.[11][19][20] His approval rating continued to lag throughout most of 2015 but began to reach the high 40s by the end of the year.[11][21] According to Gallup, Obama's approval rating reached 50 percent in March 2016, a level unseen since May 2013.[11][22] In polling conducted January 16â€“19, 2017, Obama's final approval rating was 59 percent, which placed him on par with George H. W. Bush and Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose final Gallup ratings also measured in the high 50s.[23]
Obama has maintained relatively positive public perceptions after his presidency.[24] In Gallup's retrospective approval polls of former presidents, Obama garnered a 63 percent approval rating in 2018 and again in 2023, ranking him the fourth most popular president since World War II.[25][26]
