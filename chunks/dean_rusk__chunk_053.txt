nt, intelligent, well-educated man of broad experience in world affairs who, early in life, evidenced qualities of leadership, seemed diffidently to hold back rather than to lead as secretary of state, seeming to behave, in important ways, like a sleeve-plucking follower of presidents rather than their wise and persuasive counselor.[6]
In Popular Culture
Marvel Comics features a fictionalized version of Dean Rusk named "Dell Rusk," a corrupt politician later revealed to be an alter-ego of the supervillain Red Skull. This is foreshadowed by the fact that Dell Rusk is an anagram of Red Skull.
The character of Dell Rusk also appears in the video game Marvel: Avengers Alliance, in which he is a member of the World Security Council that controls S.H.I.E.L.D.. This iteration of Dell Rusk appears to be a distinct character rather than a disguise used by Red Skull.
