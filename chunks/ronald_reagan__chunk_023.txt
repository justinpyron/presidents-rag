In August, Reagan gave a speech at the Neshoba County Fair, stating his belief in states' rights. Joseph Crespino argues that the visit was designed to reach out to Wallace-inclined voters,[46] and some[who?] also saw these actions as an extension of the Southern strategy to garner white support for Republican candidates.[47] Reagan's supporters have said that this was his typical anti-big government rhetoric, without racial context or intent.[48][49][50] In the October 28 debate, Carter chided Reagan for being against national health insurance. Reagan replied, "There you go again", though the audience laughed and viewers found him more appealing.[51] Reagan later asked the audience if they were better off than they were four years ago, slightly paraphrasing Roosevelt's words in 1934.[52] In 1983, Reagan's campaign managers were revealed to having obtained Carter's debate briefing book before the debates.[53] On November 4, 1980, Reagan won in a decisive victory in the Electoral College over Carter, carrying 44 states and receiving 489 electoral votes to Carter's 49 in six states and the District of Columbia. He won the popular vote by a narrower margin, receiving nearly 51 percent to Carter's 41 percent and Anderson's 7 percent. In the United States Congress, Republicans won a majority of seats in the Senate for the first time since 1952[54] while Democrats retained the House of Representatives.[55]
