Tilden, who had gained national fame for fighting the political corruption of William M. Tweed's Tammany Hall machine in New York City.[18] Other contenders included Governor Thomas A. Hendricks of Indiana and Major General Winfield Scott Hancock.[18] Tilden's wealth and national renown helped gather delegates to his cause, and in June 1876, he entered the convention with 404Â½ votes; Bayard placed fifth with 33.[19] Tilden was nominated on the second ballot.[19] Displeased with the result, Bayard nonetheless supported the Democratic nominee against Governor Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio, the Republican candidate, speaking to large crowds in cities across the North and Midwest.[20]
On election day, the vote was close, but appeared to favor a Tilden victory.[21] Three days later, Tilden looked to have won 184 electoral votes, one short of a majority, while Hayes appeared to have 166 votes, with the votes of Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina still in doubt.[b][22] Each party sent their people to observe the vote in the disputed states.
