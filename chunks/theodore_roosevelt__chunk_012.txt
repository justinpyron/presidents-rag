st in support of Harrison.[5] On the insistence of Henry Cabot Lodge, President Harrison appointed Roosevelt to the United States Civil Service Commission, where he served until 1895.[6] While many of his predecessors had approached the office as a sinecure,[7] Roosevelt fought the spoilsmen and demanded enforcement of civil service laws.[8] The Sun described Roosevelt as "irrepressible, belligerent, and enthusiastic".[9] Roosevelt clashed with Postmaster General John Wanamaker, who handed out patronage positions to Harrison supporters, and Roosevelt's attempt to force out several postal workers damaged Harrison politically.[10] Despite Roosevelt's support for Harrison's reelection in the 1892 presidential election, the winner, Grover Cleveland, reappointed him.[11] Roosevelt's close friend and biographer, Joseph Bucklin Bishop, described his assault on the spoils system:
 The very citadel of spoils politics, the hitherto impregnable fortress that had existed unshaken since it was erected on the foundation laid by Andrew Jackson, was tottering to its fall under the assaults of this audacious and irrepressible young man... Whatever may have been the feelings of the (fellow Republican party) President (Harrison)—and there is little doubt that he had no idea when he appointed Roosevelt that he would prove to be so veritable a bull in a china shop—he refused to remove him and stood by him firmly till the end of his term.[9]
