Nomination and confirmation
Blinken was a foreign policy advisor for Biden's 2020 presidential campaign.[1] On November 22, 2020, Bloomberg News reported that Biden had selected Blinken as his nominee for secretary of state.[2] These reports were later corroborated by The New York Times and other outlets.[3][4] On November 24, upon being announced as Biden's choice for secretary of state, Blinken said, "We can't solve all the world's problems alone [and] we need to be working with other countries."[5] He had earlier remarked in a September 2020 interview with the Associated Press that "democracy is in retreat around the world, and unfortunately it's also in retreat at home because of the president taking a two-by-four to its institutions, its values and its people every day."[6]
Blinken's confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee began on January 19, 2021. His nomination was confirmed by the committee on January 25 with a vote of 15–3.[7] On January 26, Blinken was confirmed in the full Senate by a vote of 78–22.[8] Blinken took the oath of office of the secretary of state later that day.[9] In doing so, he became the third former deputy secretary of state to serve as the Secretary of State, after Lawrence Eagleburger and Warren Christopher in 1992 and 1993, respectively.[10][11]
