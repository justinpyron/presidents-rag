Vermont after the birth of their first child, Regina.[5] They quickly moved from Burlington to Jericho, and finally to Waterville, as William received positions teaching at different schools.[1] William Arthur also spent a brief time studying law, but while still in Waterville, he departed from both his legal studies and his Presbyterian upbringing to join the Free Will Baptists; he spent the rest of his life as a minister in that denomination.[1] William Arthur became an outspoken abolitionist, which often made him unpopular with some members of his congregations and contributed to the family's frequent moves.[6]
In 1828, the family moved again, to Fairfield, where Chester Alan Arthur was born the following year; he was the fifth of nine children.[7][8] He was named "Chester" after Chester Abell,[9] the physician and family friend who assisted in his birth, and "Alan" for his paternal grandfather.[10][a] The family remained in Fairfield until 1832, when William Arthur's profession took them to churches in several towns in Vermont and upstate New York. The family finally settled in Schenectady, New York in 1844.[11]
Arthur had seven siblings who lived to adulthood:[12]
Regina (1822–1910), the wife of William G. Caw, a grocer, banker, and community leader of Cohoes, New York, who served as town supervisor and village trustee[13]
Jane (1824–1842)[14]
Almeda (1825–1899), the wife of James H. Masten who served as postmaster of Cohoes and publisher of the Cohoes Cataract newspaper
