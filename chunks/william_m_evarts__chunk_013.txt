Retirement
Senator Evarts retired from public life in 1891 due to ill health. He was still a partner in his law practice in New York City, called Evarts, Southmoyd and Choate. He died in New York City  on February 28, 1901, and was buried at Ascutney Cemetery in Windsor, Vermont.
Evarts owned numerous properties in Windsor, including Evarts Pond and a group of historic homes often referred to as Evarts Estate. The homes included 26 Main Street in Windsor. Evarts purchased this house from John Skinner in the 1820s for $5,000; it was passed down to his daughter, Elizabeth Hoar Evarts Perkins, who left the house to family members, including her son Maxwell Perkins, the renowned book editor. The house stayed in the family until 2005. It was later restored and reopened as Snapdragon Inn, which is open to the public and features a library displaying items related to the history of William M. Evarts and his extended family.
