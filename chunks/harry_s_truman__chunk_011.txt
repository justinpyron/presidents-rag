Politics

After his wartime service, Truman returned to Independence, where he married Bess Wallace on June 28, 1919.[1] The couple had one child, Mary Margaret Truman.[2]
Shortly before the wedding, Truman and Jacobson opened a haberdashery together at 104 West 12th Street in downtown Kansas City.[3] After brief initial success, the store went bankrupt during the recession of 1921.[4] Truman did not pay off the last of the debts from that venture until 1935, when he did so with the aid of banker William T. Kemper, who worked behind the scenes to enable Truman's brother Vivian to buy Truman's $5,600 promissory note during the asset sale of a bank that had failed in the Great Depression.[5][6] The note had risen and fallen in value as it was bought and sold, interest accumulated and Truman made payments, so by the time the last bank to hold it failed, it was worth nearly $9,000.[7] Thanks to Kemper's efforts, Vivian Truman was able to buy it for $1,000.[6] Jacobson and Truman remained close friends even after their store failed, and Jacobson's advice to Truman on Zionism later played a role in the U.S. Government's decision to recognize Israel.[8]
