enry Adams, and substituted for Evarts at Cabinet meetings when the Secretary was out of town.[21] In 1880, he campaigned for the Republican nominee for president, his fellow Ohioan, Congressman James A. Garfield.[22] Hay felt that Garfield did not have enough backbone, and hoped that Reid and others would "inoculate him with the gall which I fear he lacks".[23] Garfield consulted Hay before and after his election as president on appointments and other matters, but offered Hay only the post of private secretary (though he promised to increase its pay and power), and Hay declined.[24] Hay resigned as assistant secretary effective March 31, 1881, and spent the next seven months as acting editor of the Tribune during Reid's extended absence in Europe. Garfield's death in September and Reid's return the following month left Hay again on the outside of political power, looking in. He would spend the next fifteen years in that position.[25]

In 1884, Hay and Adams commissioned architect Henry Hobson Richardson
