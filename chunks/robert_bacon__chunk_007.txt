teral intervention with Mexico. An armistice was quickly declared with joint American and Mexican oversight. He also successfully negotiated the basis of a settlement of debt owed by the Dominican Republic and the return of land in Puerto Rico to the Catholic Church.[1]
Provisional Government of Cuba
The most pressing matter during Bacon's tenure as acting secretary was a rebellion leading to the collapse of the Republic of Cuba, an independent state established by the United States following a period of American military government. In response to appeals by President Tom√°s Estrada Palma, Bacon and Secretary of War William Howard Taft personally departed Washington on September 16 for a mission to Cuba, in order to negotiate peace with the rebels against Palma's government. Despite the American mission, no peace was reached; Taft accordingly issued a proclamation on September 29, 1906, establishing the Provisional Government of Cuba by the United States and proclaiming himself Provisional Governor. Taft and Bacon remained in Cuba until October 15, when administration of the island was handed to Charles Edward Magoon.[1]
Though Bacon had been involved in deliberations over the Provisional Government, he privately expressed reservations over Taft's policy, which he believed was contrary to Root's foreign policy and to Root's earlier policy as Secretary of War, including the organization of the government and drafting of the new Cuban constitution.[1]
