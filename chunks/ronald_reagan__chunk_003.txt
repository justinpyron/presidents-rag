ary service in April 1942.[9] He broke out of these types of films by portraying George Gipp in Knute Rockne, All American (1940), which would be rejuvenated when reporters called Reagan "the Gipper" while he campaigned for president of the United States.[10] Afterward, Reagan starred in Kings Row (1942) as a leg amputee, asking, "Where's the rest of me?"[11] His performance was considered his best by many critics.[12] Reagan became a star,[13] with Gallup polls placing him "in the top 100 stars" from 1941 to 1942.[12]
World War II interrupted the movie stardom that Reagan would never be able to achieve again[13] as Warner Bros. became uncertain about his ability to generate ticket sales. Reagan, who had a limited acting range, was dissatisfied with the roles he received. As a result, Lew Wasserman renegotiated his contract with his studio, allowing him to also make films with Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures, and RKO Pictures as a freelancer. With this, Reagan appeared in multiple western films, something that had been denied to him while working at Warner Bros.[14] In 1952, he ended his relationship with Warner Bros.,[15] but went on to appear in a total of 53 films,[9] his last being The Killers (1964).[16]

In April 1937, Reagan enlisted in the United States Army Reserve. He was assigned as a private in Des Moines' 322nd Cavalry Regiment and reassigned to second lieutenant in the Officers Reserve Corps.[17] He later became a part of the 323rd Cavalry
