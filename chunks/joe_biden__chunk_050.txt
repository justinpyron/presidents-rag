By the end of 2021, 40 of Biden's nominees to the federal judiciary had been confirmed, more than any president in his first year in office since Ronald Reagan.[86] Biden has prioritized diversity in his judicial appointments more than any president in U.S. history, with most of his appointees being women and people of color.[87]
In January 2022, Supreme Court justice Stephen Breyer, a moderate liberal nominated by Bill Clinton, announced his intention to retire from the Supreme Court. During his 2020 campaign, Biden vowed to nominate the first Black woman to the Supreme Court if a vacancy occurred,[88] a promise he reiterated after Breyer announced his retirement.[89] On February 25, Biden nominated federal judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court.[90] She was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on April 7[91] and sworn in on June 30.[92] By May 2024, Biden had confirmed more than 200 federal judges, about two-thirds of them women.[93]
In July 2024, during a speech at the LBJ Presidential Library, Biden expressed interest in judicial term limits and a binding ethics code for Supreme Court justices.[94]
