d consumer rights organizations opposed it.[35] As a senator, Biden strongly supported increased Amtrak funding and rail security.[6][36]
Brain surgeries
In February 1988, after several episodes of increasingly severe neck pain, Biden underwent surgery to correct a leaking intracranial berry aneurysm.[37][38] While recuperating, he suffered a pulmonary embolism, a serious complication.[38] After a second aneurysm was surgically repaired in May,[38][39] his recuperation kept him away from the Senate for seven months.[40]
Senate Judiciary Committee
Biden was a longtime member of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. He chaired it from 1987 to 1995 and was a ranking minority member from 1981 to 1987 and again from 1995 to 1997.[41]
As chair, Biden presided over two highly contentious U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings.[5] When Robert Bork was nominated in 1988, Biden reversed his approval‍—‌given in an interview the previous year‍—‌of a hypothetical Bork nomination. Conservatives were angered,[42] but at the hearings' close Biden was praised for his fairness, humor, and courage.[42][43] Rejecting the arguments of some Bork opponents,[5] Biden framed his objections to Bork in terms of the conflict between Bork's strong originalism and the view that the U.S. Constitution provides rights to liberty and privacy beyond those explicitly enumerated in its text.[43] Bork's nomination was rejected in the committee by a 5–9 vote[43] and then in the full Senate, 42–58.[44]
