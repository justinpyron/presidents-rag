Pompeo received 59% of the vote (117,171 votes) to 36% for Goyle (71,866).[7]
During Pompeo's campaign, its affiliated Twitter account praised as a "good read" a news article that called Goyle, his Indian-American opponent, a "turban topper" who "could be a Muslim, a Hindu, a Buddhist etc. who knows". Pompeo later apologized to Goyle for the tweet.[8] Pompeo received $80,000 in donations during the campaign from Koch Industries and its employees.[9]
In the 2012 election, Pompeo defeated Democratic nominee Robert Tillman by a margin of 62–32%.[10] Koch Industries gave Pompeo's campaign $110,000.[11]
