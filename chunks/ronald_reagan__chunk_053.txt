d on February 3, 1994, during a tribute to him in Washington, D.C.; his last major public appearance was at the funeral of Richard Nixon on April 27, 1994.[5] In August 1994, Reagan was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, which he announced through a handwritten letter in November.[12] There was speculation over how long he had demonstrated symptoms of mental degeneration,[13] but lay observations that he suffered from Alzheimer's while still in office have been disputed by medical experts;[14][15][16] his doctors said that he first began exhibiting overt symptoms of the illness in late 1992[17] or 1993.[16] Over time, the disease destroyed Reagan's mental capacity. By 1997, he was reported to recognize few people other than his wife, though he continued to walk through parks and on beaches, play golf, and visit his office in nearby Century City.[16] Eventually, his family decided that he would live in quiet semi-isolation with his wife.[18] By the end of 2003, Reagan had lost his ability to speak and was mostly confined to his bed, no longer able to recognize any family members.[19]
