During Clarence Thomas's nomination hearings in 1991, Biden's questions on constitutional issues were often convoluted to the point that Thomas sometimes lost track of them,[45] and Thomas later wrote that Biden's questions were akin to "beanballs".[46] After the committee hearing closed, the public learned that Anita Hill, a University of Oklahoma law school professor, had accused Thomas of making unwelcome sexual comments when they had worked together.[47][48] Biden had known of some of these charges, but initially shared them only with the committee because Hill was then unwilling to testify.[5] The committee hearing was reopened and Hill testified, but Biden did not permit testimony from other witnesses, such as a woman who had made similar charges and experts on harassment.[49] The full Senate confirmed Thomas by a 52–48 vote, with Biden opposed.[5] Liberal legal advocates and women's groups felt strongly that Biden had mishandled the hearings and not done enough to support Hill.[49] In 2019, he told Hill he regretted his treatment of her, but Hill said afterward she remained unsatisfied
