The issue became a political football and was immortalized in a cartoon captioned "What can I do when both parties insist on kicking?"[14] Harrison appointed Theodore Roosevelt and Hugh Smith Thompson, both reformers, to the Civil Service Commission, but otherwise did little to further the reform cause.[15]
In 1890 Harrison saw the enactment of the Dependent and Disability Pension Act, a cause he had championed in Congress. In addition to providing pensions to disabled Civil War veterans (regardless of the cause of their disability), the Act depleted some of the troublesome federal budget surplus. Pension expenditures reached $135 million under Harrison (equivalent to $4.6 billion in 2023), the largest expenditure of its kind to that point in American history, a problem exacerbated by Pension Bureau commissioner James R.
