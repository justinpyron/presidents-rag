er. Dozens of those who fell ill died, including Buchanan's nephew and private secretary Eskridge Lane.[9]
The cabinet selection was disastrous, with four Southern ministers being large-scale slaveholders who later became loyal to the Confederate States of America.[10] Secretary of the Treasury Howell Cobb was considered the greatest political talent in the Cabinet,[11] while the three department heads from the northern states were all considered to be doughfaces.[12]  His objective was to dominate the cabinet, and he chose men who would agree with his views.[13] Buchanan had a troubled relationship with his vice president from the beginning, when he did not receive him during his inaugural visit but referred him to his niece and First Lady, which Breckinridge never forgave him for and saw as disrespectful.[14] He left out the influential Stephen A. Douglas, who had made Buchanan's nomination possible by resigning at the National Convention the previous year, when filling the post.[15] Concentrating on foreign policy, he appointed the aging Lewis Cass as Secretary of State. Buchanan's appointment of Southerners and their allies alienated many in the North, and his failure to appoint any followers of Douglas divided the party.[9] Outside of the cabinet, he left in place many of Pierce's appointments but removed a disproportionate number of Northerners who had ties to Democratic opponents Pierce or Douglas.[14]
