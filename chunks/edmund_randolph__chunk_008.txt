ns of his characterâ€”such concerns for reputation holding great value in the 18th century. In the event, Randolph secured a published retraction from Fauchet.[10]
After his resignation, Randolph was held personally responsible for losing a large sum of money during his administration of the state department. He was eventually adjudged to owe the government more than $49,000, which he paid.[1]
Marriage to Elizabeth Nicholas
Elizabeth Nicholas was a daughter of Robert Carter Nicholas Sr, then the state treasurer of Virginia. Randolph wrote to his children after his wife's death: "We were both born in the city of Williamsburg, within twelve hours of each other; myself on the 10th of August 1753, and she on the 11th. My aunt Randolph,  who saw each of us soon after our birth, facetiously foretold that we should be united in marriage-a circumstance which, improbable at the time from the dissensions of our families, seemed daily to grow into an impossibility from their increasing rancor. In childhood we were taught the elements of reading at the same school... she won me by the best of all graces, cheerfulness, good sense, and benevolence. I do not recollect that I reflected much upon that range of qualities, which I afterwards found to be constituents of nuptial happiness; but Providence seemed to be kinder to me than my most deliberate judgment could have been... I desired nothing more than that she should sincerely persuade herself that she would be happy with me."[1]
