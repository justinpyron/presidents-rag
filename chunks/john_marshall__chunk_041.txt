arshall led an expedition on the New River after being asked by the Virginia General Assembly to chair a commission evaluating the prospect of using the James River to facilitate trade across the Appalachian Mountains.[16]  Marshall had been an early member of the James River Company that began the James River and Kanawha Canal.[17]  John Marshall chose to lead the expedition himself, accompanied by surveyor Andrew Alexander and crew, traveling upriver from Lynchburg, Virginia on September 1 in a 60-foot flat-bottomed batteau.  Portaging from the Jackson River to the Greenbrier River in a region being affected by a drought, they continued downriver, reaching the Kanawha Falls at the junction of the New River with the Gauley River on October 9.[16]  Marshall concluded that the route was unsuitable for a canal due in part to rapids on the New River,[18] but the report of the commission established a path for later highways and railroads.[16]
Other notable relatives of Marshall include first cousin U.S. Senator (Ky) Humphrey Marshall,[19] Thomas Francis Marshall,[20] Confederate Army colonel Charles Marshall, and first cousin, three times removed, General of the Army George C. Marshall.[21] Prior to becoming Chief Justice, John Marshall had served as the 4th U.S. Secretary of State and his 5-star general, future cousin George C. Marshall, would serve as the 50th U.S. Secretary of State.
