tter with Governor Richard Yates.[8] Yates quickly offered Grant a militia commission to serve as mustering officer and continue training the volunteer units which were being raised to rapidly expand the Army.[6]  Grant accepted, but continued his efforts to obtain a field command.
With Washburne's sponsorship, Grant was commissioned a colonel of volunteers on June 14, 1861, and appointed to command the 21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment.[9] During his command of the regiment and through the Vicksburg Campaign, Washburne kept in close touch with Grant through his brother, Major General Cadwallader C. Washburn.[10]
Washburne continued as Grant's advocate and defender in Washington.  In September 1861, Washburne sponsored Grant's promotion to brigadier general and command of a brigade, and supported his subsequent promotion to major general and assignments to district, field army, and military division command.[11]  Washburne was also an advocate for Grant's promotion to lieutenant general and command of the entire Union Army.[12] During the war Grant aligned himself with the Republican goals of ending slavery[13][14] and incorporating African Americans into the military.[15][16] His changed political outlook and success on the battlefield made him a likely contender for president as a Republican,[17] and Washburne supported Grant's successful campaign in 1868.[18]
