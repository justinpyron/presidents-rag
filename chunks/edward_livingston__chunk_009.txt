the French Chamber of Deputies refused to make an appropriation to pay the first installment due under the treaty in 1833, relations between the two governments became strained, and Livingston was finally instructed to close the legation and return to America.[4]
Personal life
Livingston was married twice.  His first wife, Mary McEvers, whom he wed on April 10, 1788, later died of scarlet fever.[1]  She was the daughter of Charles McEvers and Mary (née Bache) McEvers and her sister, Eliza McEvers, was the second wife of Edwards older brother, the merchant John R. Livingston.[1]  Before her death on March 13, 1801, they were the parents of three children:[2]

Charles Edward Livingston (born 1790)
Julia Livingston (1794–1814)
Lewis Livingston (1798–1822)
In June 1805, he married Madame Marie Louise Magdaleine Valentine "Louise" (née d'Avezac) de Castera Moreau de Lassy (1785–1860), a widow who was then only 19 years of age, and a refugee in New Orleans from the Haitian Revolution.[3]  She was the daughter of a wealthy landowner and the sister of Auguste Davezac, a politician and diplomat who served twice as U.S. Minister to the Netherlands.  She was a woman of extraordinary beauty and intellect:  "the lady name is short, but she is said to be majestic in her person and elegant in manners with a long purse".[4]  She is said to have greatly influenced her husband's public career.[5]  Together, Louise and Edward were the parents of two children, only one of whom lived to adulthood
