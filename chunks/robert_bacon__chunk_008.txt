Secretary of State (1909)
In January 1909, Elihu Root was elected to represent New York in the U.S. Senate, and Bacon was nominated to succeed him as Secretary of State on January 25. He was confirmed by the Senate and sworn into office on January 27, thirty-eight days before the end of Roosevelt's term in office and the inauguration of William Howard Taft as president. Taft appointed Philander C. Knox to succeed him as secretary. 
Less than three weeks before Bacon's nomination, the United States had entered into treaties with Colombia and Panama to settle disputes relating to the separation of Panama. The Colombian treaty was approved by the Senate on February 24. Bacon spent much of his term as secretary urging the approval of the Panama treaty, which was finally approved on March 3, the day before Roosevelt's term in office expired.[3] However, the treaties were rejected in Colombia, where their introduction despite widespread anti-American sentiment led to a revolution and the resignation of President Rafael Reyes.[3]
Bacon directed American participation in the London Naval Conference through February 1
