ies between 1793 and 1794.[1] Madison proposed a trade war, "[a] direct system of commercial hostility with Great Britain," assuming that Britain was so weakened by its war with France that it would agree to American terms and not declare war.[2]
Washington rejected that policy and sent Jay as a special envoy to Great Britain to negotiate a new treaty; Jay remained Chief Justice. Washington had Alexander Hamilton write instructions for Jay that were to guide him in the negotiations.[3] In March 1795, the resulting treaty, known as the Jay Treaty, was brought to Philadelphia.[3] When Hamilton, in an attempt to maintain good relations, informed Britain that the United States would not join the Second League of Armed Neutrality, Jay lost most of his leverage. The treaty resulted in Britain withdrawing from their northwestern forts[4] and granted the U.S. "most favored nation" status.[1] U.S. merchants were also granted restricted commercial access to the British West Indies.[1]
The treaty did not resolve American grievances about neutral shipping rights and impressment,[5] and the Democratic-Republicans denounced it, but Jay, as Chief Justice, decided not to take part in the debates.[6] The Royal Navy's continued impressment of American citizens would be a cause of the War of 1812.[7] The failure to receive compensation for American slaves which were freed by the British and transported away during the Revolutionary War "was a major reason for the bitter Southern opposition".[8]
