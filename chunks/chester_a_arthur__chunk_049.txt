a judge on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals for the prior four years.[66] Blatchford accepted, and his nomination was approved by the Senate within two weeks.[66] Blatchford served on the Court until his death in 1893.
Post-presidency (1885â€“1886)
Arthur left office in 1885 and returned to his New York City home. Two months before the end of his term, several New York Stalwarts approached him to request that he run for United States Senate, but he declined, preferring to return to his old law practice at Arthur, Knevals & Ransom.[1] His health limited his activity with the firm, and Arthur served only of counsel. He took on few assignments with the firm and was often too ill to leave his house.[2] He managed a few public appearances until the end of 1885.[2]

Death
After spending the summer of 1886 in New London, Connecticut, he returned home where he became seriously ill, and on November 16, ordered nearly all of his papers, both personal and official, burned.[2][a] The next morning, Arthur suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and never regained consciousness. He died the following day, on November 18, at the age of 57.[2] On November 22, a private funeral was held at the Church of the Heavenly Rest in New York City, attended by President Cleveland and ex-President Hayes, among other notables.[4] Arthur was buried with his family members and ancestors in the Albany Rural Cemetery in Menands, New York.[b] He was laid beside his wife in a sarcophagus on a large corner of the plot.
