In 2015, Pompeo opposed the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions by the United States and supported eliminating the United States federal register of greenhouse gas emissions.[51] As a member of the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce, he voted for two resolutions disapproving of the Clean Power Plan implemented by the United States Environmental Protection Agency during the Obama administration.
In May 2019, Pompeo acted against environmental protection at the Arctic Council. He refused to sign on to a joint statement addressing the need for protection of the Arctic region from the threat of rapidly melting ice unless all mentions of climate change were removed from the document. He said, "Climate change is actually good for the Arctic, since melting ice caps are 'opening up new shipping routes' and thus making it more economically viable to expand oil drilling in the region."[52][53]
He described the Paris climate accord, along with the World Health Organization and Human Rights Council, as one of the "three sins".[30]
Health care
Pompeo opposed the Affordable Care Act (ACA).[54] Pompeo has been criticized for saying he supports funding for certain programs, yet opposing them when they are a part of the ACA.[55] He accused the World Health Organization of being under control of the People's Republic of China.[28] The WHO responded by saying Pompeo's comments were unacceptable and a distraction from dealing with the coronavirus pandemic.
