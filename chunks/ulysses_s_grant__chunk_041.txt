However, the Republicans adopted his words "Let us have peace" as their campaign slogan.[31] Grant's 1862 General Order No. 11 became an issue during the presidential campaign; he sought to distance himself from the order, saying "I have no prejudice against sect or race, but want each individual to be judged by his own merit."[32] The Democrats and their Klan supporters focused mainly on ending Reconstruction, intimidating black people and Republicans, and returning control of the South to the white Democrats and the planter class, alienating War Democrats in the North.[33] Grant won the popular vote and an Electoral College landslide of 214 votes to Seymour's 80.[34] Seymour received a majority of white voters, but Grant was aided by 500,000 votes cast by black people,[35] winning him 52.7 percent of the popular vote.[36] He lost Louisiana and Georgia, primarily due to Ku Klux Klan violence against African-American voters.[37] At the age of 46, Grant was the youngest president yet elected.[38]
