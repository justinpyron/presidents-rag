He looked then precisely as though he had been weaned on a pickle."[13] Coolidge and his wife, Grace, who was a great baseball fan, once attended a Washington Senators game and sat through all nine innings without saying a word, except once when he asked her the time.[14]
As president, Coolidge's reputation as a quiet man continued. "The words of a President have an enormous weight," he would later write, "and ought not to be used indiscriminately."[15] Coolidge was aware of his stiff reputation; indeed, he cultivated it. "I think the American people want a solemn ass as a President," he once told Ethel Barrymore, "and I think I will go along with them."[16] Some historians suggest that Coolidge's image was created deliberately as a campaign tactic,[17] while others believe his withdrawn and quiet behavior to be natural, deepening after the death of his son in 1924.[18] Dorothy Parker, upon learning that Coolidge had died, reportedly remarked, "How can they tell?"[19]
