73, and was succeeded by Democrat Francis R. Swift.[19][20] During his time on the county council, Biden opposed large highway projects, which he argued might disrupt Wilmington neighborhoods.[20]
Biden had not openly supported or opposed the Vietnam War until he ran for Senate and opposed Richard Nixon's conduct of the war.[21] While studying at the University of Delaware and Syracuse University, Biden obtained five student draft deferments at a time when most draftees were sent to the war. Based on a physical examination, he was given a conditional medical deferment in 1968; in 2008, a spokesperson for Biden said his having had "asthma as a teenager" was the reason for the deferment.[22]
1972 U.S. Senate campaign in Delaware
Main article: 1972 United States Senate election in Delaware
Biden defeated Republican incumbent J. Caleb Boggs to become the junior U.S. senator from Delaware in 1972. He was the only Democrat willing to challenge Boggs and, with minimal campaign funds, he was thought to have no chance of winning.[8][10] Family members managed and staffed the campaign, which relied on meeting voters face-to-face and hand-distributing position papers,[23] an approach made feasible by Delaware's small size.[11] He received help from the AFL-CIO and Democratic pollster Patrick Caddell.[8] His platform focused on the environment, withdrawal from Vietnam, civil rights, mass transit, equitable taxation, health care and public dissatisfaction with "politics as usual".[8][23]
