egacy to present himself as the president of the common man,[29] praising Jackson for saving the country from a rising aristocracy and protecting American workers with a tariff.[30] In 2016, President Barack Obama's administration announced it was removing Jackson's portrait from the $20 bill and replacing it with one of Harriet Tubman.[31] Though the plan was put on hold during Trump's presidency, President Joe Biden's administration resumed it in 2021.[32]
Jackson was historically rated highly as a president, but his reputation began to decline in the 1960s.[33][34] His contradictory legacy is shown in opinion polls. A 2014 survey of political scientists rated Jackson as the ninth-highest rated president but the third-most polarizing. He was also ranked the third-most overrated president.[35]  In a C-SPAN poll of historians, Jackson was ranked the 13th in 2009, 18th in 2017, and 22nd in 2021.[36]
