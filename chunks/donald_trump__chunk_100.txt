 women's physical appearances, and referred to them using derogatory epithets.[70][71][72][73] At least 26 women publicly accused Trump of rape, kissing without consent, groping, looking under women's skirts, and walking in on naked teenage pageant contestants.[74][75][76] Trump has denied the allegations.[76]
In October 2016, two days before the second presidential debate, a 2005 "hot mic" recording surfaced in which Trump bragged on Access Hollywood about groping women and kissing them without their consent, saying:
when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. ... Grab 'em by the pussy.[77]
The incident's widespread media exposure led to Trump's first public apology during the campaign[78] and caused outrage across the political spectrum.[79]
