f scientific interests related to agriculture were widely recognized, and he served as the first president of the Worcester Agricultural Society, founded in 1818.[9]
Lincoln was additionally a founding member of the American Antiquarian Society along with one of his sons Levi Lincoln Jr. in 1812.[10]
Lincoln died in Worcester on April 14, 1820. His original burial site is not documented in the family genealogy, but he was eventually reinterred at Worcester Rural Cemetery after its establishment in 1838.[11][12]
Family and legacy
Lincoln married Martha Waldo (1761â€“1828) of Worcester in 1781, with whom he had ten children (three of whom died young).[1] His eldest child, Levi Jr., and a younger son Enoch both followed their father into politics: Levi Jr. became one of the longest-serving governors of Massachusetts, and Enoch was Governor of Maine.[2]
When Lincoln moved to Worcester, he acquired a large tract of land near what is now the downtown area of the city. This land was mostly developed by his heirs, and is part of the Lincoln Estate-Elm Park Historic District.[3] Worcester's Gov. Levi Lincoln House is named for Levi Jr.[4] As a consequence of the family's prominence in the city, there are a number of landmarks (streets, buildings, and parks) in Worcester bearing the Lincoln name.[5]
Lincoln was distantly related to Abraham Lincoln, sharing a common ancestor with the sixteenth U.S. president in Samuel Lincoln, who had settled in Hingham, Massachusetts, in the 17th century
