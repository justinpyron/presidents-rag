After the death of Chief Justice Edward Douglass White, Day proposed to President (and fellow Ohioan) Warren G. Harding a plan to crown his legal career by appointing him chief justice and serve for six months before retiring and letting former president William Howard Taft become chief justice. Harding considered the proposal but Taft felt, when he learned of this plan, that a short-term appointment would not serve the office well, and that once confirmed by the Senate, the memory of Day would grow dim.
Baseball
Day was an avid baseball fan.[5] He would often leave the Court after oral argument and go straight to Boundary Field to watch the Washington Senators play. Day is recorded as asking his clerk for "regular updates" during the bench hearing of Standard Sanitary Mfg. Co. v. United States about the final game of the 1912 World Series.[6]
Retirement and death

Day retired from the court on November 13, 1922,[1] and briefly served as an Umpire of the Mixed Claims Commission to Adjudicate War Claims against Germany.[1] He died on July 9, 1923, in his home in the Annex (now named Day Cottage) on Mackinac Island in Michigan, aged 74.[1] He was interred at West Lawn Cemetery in Canton.[2]
Family

Day married Mary Elizabeth Schaefer, daughter of Louis Schaefer, of Canton on August 24, 1875. They were married until her death in 1912, and were the parents of four sons: William L., Rufus S., Stephen A.,
