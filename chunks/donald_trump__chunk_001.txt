Real estate
Starting in 1968, Trump was employed at his father's real estate company, Trump Management, which owned racially segregated middle-class rental housing in New York City's outer boroughs.[2][3] In 1971, his father made him president of the company and he began using the Trump Organization as an umbrella brand.[4] Between 1991 and 2009, he filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for six of his businesses: the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, the casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and the Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts company.[5]
Manhattan and Chicago developments
Trump attracted public attention in 1978 with the launch of his family's first Manhattan venture, the renovation of the derelict Commodore Hotel, adjacent to Grand Central Terminal.[6] The financing was facilitated by a $400 million city property tax abatement arranged for Trump by his father who also, jointly with Hyatt, guaranteed a $70 million bank construction loan.[3][7] The hotel reopened in 1980 as the Grand Hyatt Hotel,[8] and that same year, Trump obtained rights to develop Trump Tower, a mixed-use skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan.[9] The building houses the headquarters of the Trump Corporation and Trump's PAC and was Trump's primary residence until 2019.[10][11]
In 1988, Trump acquired the Plaza Hotel with a loan from a consortium of sixteen banks.[12] The hotel filed for bankruptcy prot
