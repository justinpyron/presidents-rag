r respective delegates at the convention were unable to unite around one candidate, and Scott took the nomination on the 53rd ballot.[26] Webster was personally devastated by the defeat, and he refused to endorse Scott's candidacy.[27] Webster allowed various third party groups to nominate him for president, although he did not openly condone these efforts.[28] Scott proved to be a poor candidate, and he suffered the worst defeat in Whig history, losing to Democratic nominee Franklin Pierce.[29] Thousands of anti-Scott Whigs and members of the nativist Native American Party cast their vote for Webster.[30]
Personal life, family, and religious views

If we work upon marble, it will perish; if we work upon brass, time will efface it; if we rear temples, they will crumble to dust; but if we work on men's immortal minds, if we impress on them with high principles, the just fear of God and love for their fellow-men, we engrave on those tablets something which no time can efface, and which will brighten and brighten to all eternity.
Daniel Webster (May 22, 1852)
In 1808, Webster married Grace Fletcher, a schoolteacher and the daughter of a New Hampshire clergyman.[1] Between 1810 and 1822, Daniel and Grace had five children: Grace, Daniel "Fletcher", Julia, Edward, and Charles. Grace and Charles died before reaching adulthood.[2] Webster's wife, Grace, died in January 1828 due to a cancerous tumor,[3] and Webster suffered another loss when his brother, Ezekiel, died in April 1829.[
