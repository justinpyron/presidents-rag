1877, and a year later, on June 11, 1878, he was named the Chief of the department's Diplomatic Bureau.[1] On July 18, 1882, he was promoted to Third Assistant Secretary, and on August 3, 1886, he was promoted again to Second Assistant Secretary,[1] a position he held until his death 38 years later.
He received the degree of A.M. from Yale University in 1888.[1] The apex of Adee's career came during the Spanishâ€“American War in 1898. The Secretary of State, John Sherman, was old and in poor health, and the Assistant Secretary of State, William R. Day, was inexperienced in diplomacy, which meant that Adee, as the third-ranking officer in the department, effectively supervised U.S. diplomacy during the war. With both Sherman and Day having left the department, from September 17 to 29 of that year, Adee became acting Secretary of State in name as well as fact for two weeks,[1] until John Hay returned from England to take over as the new Secretary.
Adee was again in effective charge of the State Department during the Boxer Rebellion in August and September, 1900,[1] because Hay was ill and the Assistant Secretary David Jayne Hill was away from Washington.
