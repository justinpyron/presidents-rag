Early life, education, and legal career
Washburne was born on September 23, 1816, in Livermore, when Maine was part of Massachusetts.[1] He was the third oldest of eleven children born to Israel and Martha (n√©e Benjamin) Washburn.[2] Washburne was the grandson of Captain Israel and Abiah (King) Washburne.[2] His grandfather served as an officer in the Continental Army during the American Revolution and was a descendant of John Washburne, who served as Secretary of the Plymouth Colony while in England.[2] John Washburne was a Puritan colonist who emigrated to America in 1631 and settled in Duxbury, Massachusetts.[2]
Washburne's father settled in Maine in 1806 and set up a shipbuilding trade at Whites Landing on the Kennebec River in 1808.[2] Following Puritan heritage, Israel was a strict disciplinarian and Washburne and his siblings were instructed in the Bible and put to work daily in the fields and on other chores, with no time for leisure.[3] During the winter months Washburne attended district schools that used "birch rod" corporal punishment.[3] Washburne's family fell on financial hard times in 1829, and his father, who was then in the mercantile business, was forced to sell his general store.[1][2] The family was destitute and forced to rely on farming for subsistence, whi
