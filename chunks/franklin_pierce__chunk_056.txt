Several New Hampshire historical markers commemorate Pierce and his family around New Hampshire.[6]
Several institutions and places have been named after Pierce, many in New Hampshire:
The Franklin Pierce University in Rindge, New Hampshire, was chartered in 1962.[7]
The University of New Hampshire School of Law was founded in 1973 as the Franklin Pierce Law Center. When the school was renamed in 2010, a Franklin Pierce Center for Intellectual Property was established.[8]
There is a Mt. Pierce in the Presidential Range of New Hampshire's White Mountains, renamed from Mt. Clinton in 1913.[9]
The small town of Pierceton, Indiana, was founded in the 1850s and honors President Pierce.[10]
Pierce County, Washington, the second most populous county in the state, is named in honor of President Pierce.[11]
Pierce County, Georgia, established in 1857, is also named in honor of President Pierce.[12]
Legacy

After his death, Pierce mostly passed from the American consciousness, except as one of a series of presidents whose disastrous tenures led to civil war.[1] Pierce's presidency is widely regarded as a failure; he is often described as one of the worst presidents in American history.[note 1]
