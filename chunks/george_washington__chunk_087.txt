In 1809, Mason Locke Weems wrote a hagiographic biography to honor Washington.[13] Historian Ron Chernow maintains that Weems attempted to humanize Washington, making him look less stern, and to inspire "patriotism and morality" and to foster "enduring myths", such as Washington's refusal to lie about damaging his father's cherry tree.[14][15] Weems' accounts have never been proven or disproven.[16] Historian John Ferling, however, maintains that Washington remains the only founder and president ever to be referred to as "godlike", and points out that his character has been the most scrutinized by historians.[17] Biographer Douglas Southall Freeman concluded, "The great big thing stamped across that man is character." Expanding on Freeman's assessment, historian David Hackett Fischer defined Washington's character as "integrity, self-discipline, courage, absolute honesty, resolve, and decision, but also forbearance, decency, and respect for others".[18] Polls of historians have consistently placed Washington among the highest-ranked of presidents.[19][20]

He also maintains that Washington never advocated outright confiscation
