o have had affairs with Marilyn Monroe,[36] Judith Campbell,[37] Mary Pinchot Meyer,[38] Marlene Dietrich,[39] White House intern Mimi Alford,[40] and his wife's press secretary, Pamela Turnure.[41] There have been several conspiracy theories surrounding the death of Monroe, alleging that Kennedy may have had a part in her death.[42]
The full extent of Kennedy's relationship with Monroe (who in 1962 famously sang "Happy Birthday, Mr. President" at Kennedy's birthday celebration at Madison Square Garden) is not known, though it has been reported that they spent a weekend together in March 1962 while he was staying at Bing Crosby's house.[43] Furthermore, people at the White House switchboard noted that Monroe had called Kennedy during 1962.[44] J. Edgar Hoover, the FBI director, received reports about Kennedy's indiscretions.[45] These included an alleged tryst with an East German spy, Ellen Rometsch. According to historian Michael Beschloss, in July 1963, Hoover reportedly informed Robert Kennedy about the affair with a woman "suspected as a Soviet intelligence agent, someone linked to East German intelligence." Robert reportedly took the matter sufficiently seriously to raise it with leading Democratic and Republican figures in Congress.[46][47] Former Secret Service agent Larry Newman recalled "morale problems" that the president's indiscretions engendered within the Secret Service.[48]
Kennedy inspired affection and loyalty from the members of his team and his supporters.[
