Later in his career, Clay became increasingly concerned about abolitionism, remarking that "the ultraism of the South on the one hand [...] and the ultraism of abolition on the other" represented the greatest threat to the Union. Nonetheless, he consistently defended the right of abolitionists to send materials through the mail and opposed the gag rule, which limited congressional debate on slavery.[15]
On his 600-acre plantation, there were 122 slaves held over the course of his life.[16] Clay's status as a slave owner and his anti-slavery views occasionally led to conflicts in his political career.  During a visit to Indiana in the 1840s, Clay was confronted at a political meeting by a Quaker abolitionist, Hiram Mendenhall, who presented Clay with a petition calling on him to free his slaves. Clay dismissed Mendenhall out of hand, stating that the petition was no different from if it demanded he give up his farm.[17]
Many of his contemporaries, including anti-slavery activist James G. Birney, believed that Clay's home state of Kentucky had the laws most permissive to slaves of any slave state. Clay considered himself to be a "good" master. Biographer James C. Klotter concludes that Clay took actions, such as keeping families together, to mitigate the harshness of slavery. However, showing the opposite is his treatment of the family of Lewis Hayden.[18] Klotter also states that there is no evidence that Clay ever had sex with any of his slaves.
