s and instead frequently consulted with Gallatin alone.[7] Early in his presidency, Madison sought to continue Jefferson's policies of low taxes and a reduction of the national debt.[8] In 1811, Congress allowed the charter of the First Bank of the United States to lapse after Madison declined to take a strong stance on the issue.[9]

Prelude to war
Congress had repealed the Embargo Act of 1807 shortly before Madison became president, but troubles with the British and French continued.[10] Madison settled on a new strategy that was designed to pit the British and French against each other, offering to trade with whichever country would end their attacks against American shipping. The gambit almost succeeded, but negotiations with the British collapsed in mid-1809.[11] Seeking to drive a wedge between the Americans and the British, Napoleon offered to end French attacks on American shipping so long as the United States punished any countries that did not similarly end restrictions on trade.[12] Madison accepted Napoleon's proposal in the hope that it would convince the British to finally end their policy of commercial warfare. Notwithstanding, the British refused to change their policies, and the French reneged on their promise and continued to attack American shipping.[13]
With sanctions and other policies having failed, Madison determined that war with Britain was the only remaining option.[
