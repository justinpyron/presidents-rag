In 1976, Rodham temporarily relocated to Indianapolis to work as an Indiana state campaign organizer for the presidential campaign of Jimmy Carter.[19][20] In November 1976, Bill Clinton was elected Arkansas attorney general, and the couple moved to the state capital of Little Rock.[13] In February 1977, Rodham joined the venerable Rose Law Firm, a bastion of Arkansan political and economic influence.[21] She specialized in patent infringement and intellectual property law[22] while working pro bono in child advocacy.[23] In 1977, Rodham cofounded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, a state-level alliance with the Children's Defense Fund.[22][24]
Later in 1977, President Jimmy Carter (for whom Rodham had been the 1976 campaign director of field operations in Indiana)[25] appointed her to the board of directors of the Legal Services Corporation.[26] She held that position from 1978 until the end of 1981.[27] From mid-1978 to mid-1980,[a] she served as the first female chair of that board.[28]
Following her husband's November 1978 election as governor of Arkansas, Rodham became that state's first lady in January 1979.

Clinton appointed his wife to be the chair of the Rural Health Advisory Committee the same year,[29] in which role she secured federal funds to expand medical facilities in Arkansas's poorest area
