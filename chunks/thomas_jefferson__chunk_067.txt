At the onset of the American Revolution, Jefferson accepted William Blackstone's argument that property ownership would sufficiently empower voters' independent judgement, but he sought to further expand suffrage by land distribution to the poor.[37] In the heat of the Revolutionary Era and afterward, several states expanded voter eligibility from landed gentry to all propertied male, tax-paying citizens with Jefferson's support.[38] In retirement, he gradually became critical of his home state for violating "the principle of equal political rights"â€”the social right of universal male suffrage.[39] He sought a "general suffrage" of all taxpayers and militia-men, and equal representation by population in the General Assembly to correct preferential treatment of the slave-holding regions.[40]
Religion
Main article: Religious views of Thomas Jefferson
Baptized in his youth, Jefferson became a governing member of his local Episcopal Church in Charlottesville, which he later attended with his daughters.[41] Jefferson, however, spurned Biblical views of Christianity.[42] Influenced by Deist authors during his college years, Jefferson abandoned orthodox Christianity after his review of New Testament teachings.[43][44] Jefferson has sometimes been portrayed as a follower of the liberal religious strand of Deism that values reason over revelation.[45] Nonetheless, in 1803, Jefferson asserted, "I am Christian, in the only sense in which [Jesus] wished any one to be".[46
