es Ludlam (1766–1852).[1][2] Mary was the older sister of Lewis Gouverneur Morris (1808–1900), the granddaughter of Richard Morris (1730–1810), Chief Justice of the New York Supreme Court,[3] the great-granddaughter of Lewis Morris, an early colonial governor of New Jersey, and the grandniece of Lewis Morris (1726–1798), a signer of the Declaration of Independence.[4][5] Hamilton later recalled their first years of marriage:

Both I and my wife were without means – our parents not being in a situation to do much for us. This I have always considered the most fortunate event of my life. I realized the embarrassments of my situation, and met them with the determination to overcome them. Nor did my resolution fail of its reward. Our self-denials were great, indeed, but our faith in the future was greater...Our poverty was so extreme that during our first year we boarded at four dollars per week for each. I now look back upon this event as not only the happiest, but the most fortunate occurrence of my long and eventful life. My poverty, with its burdens and responsibilities, nerved me to exertion, and necessity taught me the value of economy and self-denial.[2]
Together, Hamilton and his wife had five children:[2][5][6][7][8]
Elizabeth "Eliza" Hamilton (1811–1863), who married her first cousin once-removed George Lee Schuyler (1811–1890), the son of Philip Jeremiah Schuyler
Frances "Fanny" Hamilton (1813–1887), who married George Russel James Bowdoin (1809–1870).
