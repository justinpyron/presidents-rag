but Johnson never did. Warren G. Harding instead emerged as the compromise candidate, and Harding went on to win the 1920 election.[9] After the election, Knox urged President Harding to consider Andrew Mellon for the position of Secretary of the Treasury, and Mellon ultimately took the position.[10]
In April 1921, he introduced a Senate resolution to bring a formal end to American involvement in World War I. It was combined with a similar House resolution to create the Knoxâ€“Porter Resolution, signed by President Warren G. Harding on July 2.[11]
Personal life
Knox's nickname was "Sleepy Phil," as he was said to have dozed off during board meetings, or because he was cross-eyed.[1]
Knox was a member of the elite Duquesne Club in Pittsburgh.[citation needed][2]
Death
Knox died in Washington, D.C., on October 12, 1921, aged 68.
