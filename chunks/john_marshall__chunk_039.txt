red two miscarriages and lost two infants, which affected her health during the rest of her life.[4] The Marshalls had six children who survived until adulthood: Thomas (who would eventually serve in the Virginia House of Delegates), Jaquelin, Mary, James, and Edward.[5]
Marshall loved his Richmond home, built in 1790,[6] and spent as much time there as possible in quiet contentment.[7][8] After his father's death in 1803, Marshall inherited the Oak Hill estate, where he and his family also spent time.[9] For approximately three months each year, Marshall lived in Washington during the Court's annual term, boarding with Justice Story during his final years at the Ringgold-Carroll House. Marshall also left Virginia for several weeks each year to serve on the circuit court in Raleigh, North Carolina. From 1810 to 1813, he also maintained the D. S. Tavern property in Albemarle County, Virginia.[10]
Marshall was not religious, and although his grandfather was a priest, never formally joined a church. He did not believe Jesus was a divine being,[11] and in some of his opinions referred to a deist "Creator of all things." He was an active Freemason and served as Grand Master of Masons in Virginia in 1794â€“1795 of the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of Ancient, Free, and Accepted Masons of the Commonwealth of Virginia.[12]
While in Richmond, Marshall played an active role in the civic life of the city. Through his leadership and campaigning the Richmond Theatre was built in 1806.[13] Whe
