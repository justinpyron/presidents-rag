 cost.[41] On the other hand, Congress wanted a bill that would place the federal government completely in charge of flood mitigation.[42] When Congress passed a compromise measure in 1928, Coolidge declined to take credit for it and signed the bill in private on May 15.[43]
Civil rights
According to one biographer, Coolidge was "devoid of racial prejudice", but rarely took the lead on civil rights. Coolidge disliked the Ku Klux Klan and no Klansman is known to have received an appointment from him. In the 1924 presidential election his opponents (Robert La Follette and John Davis), and his running mate Charles Dawes, often attacked the Klan but Coolidge avoided the subject.[44] Due to Coolidge's failure to condemn the Klan, some African-American leaders such as former Taft assistant attorney general William Henry Lewis endorsed Davis over Coolidge.[45] Davis got little of the black vote outside Indiana, where Klan control of the Indiana Republican Party caused many blacks to vote Democratic;[46] it is estimated that over 90% of non-Indiana blacks voted for Coolidge.[47] Coolidge's secretary of commerce, Herbert Hoover, was accused of running forced labor camps for African Americans during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, which led more African Americans to vote Democratic when Hoover was the Republican presidential nominee in 1928 and 1932.[48][49] During Coolidge's administration, lynchings of African-Americans decreased and millions of people left the Ku Klux Klan.[50]
