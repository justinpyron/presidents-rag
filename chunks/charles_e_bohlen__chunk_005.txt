r was still vacant, and the embassy was still being led by Beam. In April 1953, Eisenhower named Bohlen as ambassador to the Soviet Union. 
The confirmation hearings were difficult as despite a recommendation from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Bohlen's presence at Yalta was held against him by Democratic and Republican members of the Conservative coalition which controlled the Senate at the time. He was particularly criticized by Senator Joseph McCarthy, who had also criticized Bohlen's brother-in-law, also an affiliate of the US embassy in Moscow, Charles W. Thayer.[9] However both the Republican leader Robert Taft and the Democrat leader Lyndon Johnson, both associated with the coalition, supported him and Eisenhower's support was unstinting.  [10]  He was confirmed 74â€“13.
Bohlen oversaw several key events during his time as ambassador to the Soviet Union, including the rise of Georgy Malenkov to the premiership, the arrest and execution of Lavrentiy Beria, the ascendency of Nikita Khrushchev, the Hungarian Revolution and the Suez Crisis.[1]
Bohlen's relationship with US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles soured.[1] He was demoted on April 18, 1957 by Eisenhower after Dulles forced Bohlen's resignation.
Bohlen later served as ambassador to the Philippines from 1957 to 1959. He returned to the US in 1959 by request of Secretary of State Christian Herter to serve in the newly-formed Bureau of Soviet Affairs.[11]
He served as ambassador to France from 1962 to 1968
