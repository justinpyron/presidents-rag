ed war with Germany and attacked Wilson's refusal to build up the army in anticipation of war.[64] After the sinking of the Lusitania and the resignation of Bryan, Wilson publicly committed himself to what became known as the "preparedness movement", and began to build up the army and the navy.[65] In June 1916, Congress passed the National Defense Act of 1916, which established the Reserve Officers' Training Corps and expanded the National Guard.[66] Later in the year, Congress passed the Naval Act of 1916, which provided for a major expansion of the navy.[67]
Remarriage
The health of Ellen Wilson declined after her husband entered office, and doctors diagnosed her with Bright's disease in July 1914.[68] She died on August 6, 1914.[69] President Wilson was deeply affected by the loss, falling into depression.[70] On March 18, 1915, Wilson met Edith Bolling Galt at a White House tea.[71] Galt was a widow and jeweler who was also from the South. After several meetings, Wilson fell in love with her, and he proposed marriage to her in May 1915. Galt initially rebuffed him, but Wilson was undeterred and continued the courtship.[72] Edith gradually warmed to the relationship, and they became engaged in September 1915.[73] They were married on December 18, 1915. Woodrow Wilson joined John Tyler and Grover Cleveland as the only presidents to marry while in office.[74]
