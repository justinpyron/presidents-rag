voodoo economics", Bush still faced opposition from many conservatives in the Republican Party.[27] His major rivals for the Republican nomination were Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, Representative Jack Kemp of New York, and Christian televangelist Pat Robertson.[28] Reagan did not publicly endorse any candidate but privately expressed support for Bush.[29]
Though considered the early front-runner for the nomination, Bush came in third in the Iowa caucus, behind Dole and Robertson.[30] Much as Reagan had done in 1980, Bush reorganized his staff and concentrated on the New Hampshire primary.[1] With help from Governor John H. Sununu and an effective campaign attacking Dole for raising taxes, Bush overcame an initial polling deficit and won New Hampshire with 39 percent of the vote.[31] After Bush won South Carolina and 16 of the 17 states holding a primary on Super Tuesday, his competitors dropped out of the race.[32]
Bush, occasionally criticized for his lack of eloquence compared to Reagan, delivered a well-received speech at the Republican convention. Known as the "thousand points of light" speech, it described Bush's vision of America: he endorsed the Pledge of Allegiance, prayer in schools, capital punishment, and gun rights.[33] Bush also pledged that he would not raise taxes, stating: "Congress will push me to raise taxes, and I'll say no, and they'll push, and I'll say no, and they'll push again. And all I can say to them is: read my lips. No new taxes."[34
