 Robert Byrd, a prominent Senate institutionalist[3] who was concerned with executive over-reach, voted against Rice's appointment, indicating that she "has asserted that the President holds far more of the war power than the Constitution grants him."[4]
As Secretary of State, Rice championed the expansion of democratic governments and other American values: "American values are universal."[5] "An international order that reflects our values is the best guarantee of our enduring national interest ..."[6] Rice stated that the September 11 attacks in 2001 were rooted in "oppression and despair" and so, the U.S. must advance democratic reform and support basic rights throughout the greater Middle East.[7]
Rice also reformed and restructured the department, as well as U.S. diplomacy as a whole. "Transformational Diplomacy" is the goal that Rice describes as "work[ing] with our many partners around the world ... [and] build[ing] and sustain[ing] democratic, well-governed states that will respond to the needs of their people and conduct themselves responsibly in the international system."[8]
As Secretary of State, Rice traveled heavily and initiated many diplomatic efforts on behalf of the Bush administration;[9] she holds the record for most miles logged in the position.[10] Her diplomacy relied on strong presidential support and is considered to be the continuation of style defined by former Republican secretaries of state Henry Kissinger and James Baker.[9]
