ng the Senate to approve the treaty by the requisite two-thirds vote, but his lobbying, and that of Vice President Hobart, eventually saw success, as the Senate voted in favor on February 6, 1899, 57 to 27.[43]
Hawaii
During the war, McKinley also pursued the annexation of the Republic of Hawaii. The new republic, dominated by business interests, had overthrown the Queen in 1893 when she rejected a limited role for herself.[44] There was strong American support for annexation, and the need for Pacific bases in wartime became clear after the Battle of Manila.[45] McKinley came to office as a supporter of annexation, and lobbied Congress to act, warning that to do nothing would invite a royalist counter-revolution or a Japanese takeover.[45] Foreseeing difficulty in getting two-thirds of the Senate to approve a treaty of annexation, McKinley instead supported the effort of Democratic Representative Francis G. Newlands of Nevada to accomplish the result by joint resolution of both houses of Congress.[46] The resulting Newlands Resolution passed both houses by wide margins, and McKinley signed it into law on July 8, 1898.[46] McKinley biographer H. Wayne Morgan notes, "McKinley was the guiding spirit behind the annexation of Hawaii, showingÂ ... a firmness in pursuing it";[47] the president told Cortelyou, "We need Hawaii just as much and a good deal more than we did California. It is manifest destiny."[48]
