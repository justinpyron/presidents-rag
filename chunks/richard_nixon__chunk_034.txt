It also gave him the opportunity to snub the print journalists he despised.[10]
Nixon and Kissinger immediately met for an hour with CCP Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou at Mao's official private residence, where they discussed a range of issues.[11] Mao later told his doctor that he had been impressed by Nixon's forthrightness, unlike the leftists and the Soviets.[11] He said he was suspicious of Kissinger,[11] though the National Security Advisor referred to their meeting as his "encounter with history".[10] A formal banquet welcoming the presidential party was given that evening in the Great Hall of the People. The following day, Nixon met with Zhou; the joint communique following this meeting recognized Taiwan as a part of China and looked forward to a peaceful solution to the problem of reunification.[12] When not in meetings, Nixon toured architectural wonders, including the Forbidden City, the Ming tombs, and the Great Wall.[10] Americans took their first glance into everyday Chinese life through the cameras that accompanied Pat Nixon, who toured the city of Beijing and visited communes, schools, factories, and hospitals.[10]
The visit ushered in a new era of US–China relations.[13] Fearing the possibility of a US–China alliance, the Soviet Union yielded to pressure for détente with the United States.[14] This was one component of triangular diplomacy.[15]
