it that role and he approved. However, he had deep distrust of both Germany and Russia.[10]
Legacy
Historians credit Roosevelt for changing the nation's political system by placing the "bully pulpit" of the presidency at center stage and emphasizing character as much as issues. His accomplishments include trust busting and conservationism. He is a hero to liberals and progressives for his early proposals that foreshadowed the modern welfare state, including federal taxation, labor reforms, and more direct democracy. Conservationists admire Roosevelt for prioritizing the environment and selflessness towards future generations. Conservatives and nationalists respect his commitment to law and order, civic duty, and military values. Dalton states, "Today he is heralded as the architect of the modern presidency, as a world leader who boldly reshaped the office to meet the needs of the new century."[1]
Liberals and socialists criticize his interventionist and imperialist approach, while libertarians reject his vision of the welfare state. Historians typically rank Roosevelt among the top five presidents.[2][3]
Persona and masculinity
Dalton says Roosevelt is remembered as "one of the most picturesque personalities who has ever enlivened the landscape".[4] His friend, historian Henry Adams, proclaimed: "Roosevelt, more than any other man... showed the singular primitive quality that belongs to ultimate matter—the quality that medieval theology assigned to God—he was pure act".[5] Co
