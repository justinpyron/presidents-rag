canal to bypass Vicksburg, incorporating the laborers into the Union Army and Navy.[62]
Grant's war responsibilities included combating illegal Northern cotton trade and civilian obstruction.[63][b] He had received numerous complaints about Jewish speculators in his district.[66] The majority, however, of those involved in illegal trading were not Jewish.[67] To help combat this, Grant required two permits, one from the Treasury and one from the Union Army, to purchase cotton.[64] On December 17, 1862, Grant issued a controversial General Order No. 11, expelling "Jews, as a class", from his military district.[68] After complaints, Lincoln rescinded the order on January 3, 1863. Grant finally ended the order on January 17. He later described issuing the order as one of his biggest regrets.[c][72]
On January 29, 1863, Grant assumed overall command. To bypass Vicksburg's guns, Grant slowly advanced his Union army south through water-logged terrain.[73] The plan of attacking Vicksburg from downriver was risky because, east of the river, his army would be distanced from most of its supply lines,[74] and would have to rely on foraging. On April 16, Grant ordered Admiral David Dixon Porter's gunboats south under fire from the Vicksburg batteries to meet up with troops who had marched south down the west side of the river.[75] Grant ordered diversionary battles, confusing Pemberton and allowing Grant's army to move east across the Mississippi.[76] Grant's army captured Jackson.
