Selection
On December 12, 1960, Democratic President-elect John F. Kennedy nominated Rusk to be Secretary of State.  Rusk was not Kennedy's first choice; his first choice, J. William Fulbright, proved too controversial.[1] David Halberstam also described Rusk as "everybody's number two".[2] Rusk had recently written an article titled "The President" in Foreign Affairs calling for the president to direct foreign policy with the secretary of state as a mere adviser, which had Kennedy's interest after it was pointed out to him.[3]  After deciding that Fulbright's support for segregation disqualified him, Kennedy summoned Rusk for a meeting, where he himself endorsed Fulbright as the man best qualified to be Secretary of State.[3] Rusk himself was not particularly interested in running the State Department as the annual pay for secretary of state was $25,000
