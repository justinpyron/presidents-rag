Death and funeral

Muskie died at 4:06 AM EST on the morning of March 26, 1996, at the Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, D.C., after seeking treatment for bouts of congestive heart failure.[1] He died two days shy of his 82nd birthday. Eight days prior he underwent a carotid endarterectomy in his right neck.[2] His assistant reported that he had suffered a myocardial infarction.[2] Some historians believe that his blood clots were brought on from frequent 8,421 mile (13,552Â km) flights to Cambodia; he was asked to assist in stabilizing its government[3] on behalf of President Bill Clinton.[4]
Due to his service in the United States Naval Reserve during World War II, he was eligible to be buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia.[2][5] His ultimate rank of lieutenant had him placed in Section 25 of the cemetery.[6][7] Although he died on March 26, his grave stone initially noted that he died on the 25th. His wife, Jane, died on December 25, 2004, at age 77, due to health complications brought on by Alzheimer's disease.[8] She was buried next to Muskie and his grave stone was corrected to read "March 26, 1996".[9]
