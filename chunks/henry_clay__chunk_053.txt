ved 12 years for aiding in another escape.[27]
Another example is Lewis Richardson, Clay's self-emancipated slave. He gave a speech that belies Clay's self-portrayal as a "good" master. Richardson had been enslaved at Ashland for 20 years, and after a beating escaped via the Underground Railroad in January, 1846. By May of that year, Richardson was also living in Amherstburg, Ontario. In a speech he gave at Union Chapel there, he told not only of continual sparse food and lack of warm clothing, but of 150 lashes from overseer Ambrose Brice for the offense of being an hour late returning from a visit to his wife.[28] Brice later denied this claim, stating it was 16 lashes, and the offense was drunkenness. Clay was away on business when this occurred.[20] Richardson's speech was published in an abolitionist newspaper, Signal of Liberty.[26][29] The text of his speech is available at the following reference.[30]
In 1829, Charlotte Dupuy, who was enslaved by Clay, sued for her freedom while visiting relatives in Maryland. Dupuy's attorney gained an order from the court for her to remain in Washington until the case was settled, and she worked for wages for 18 months for Martin Van Buren, Clay's successor as secretary of state.[31] The case embarrassed Clay politically and personally, but he ultimately prevailed in court. After winning the case, Clay sent Dupuy to New Orleans, causing her to be away from her own family, but he later freed Dupuy and two of her children.
