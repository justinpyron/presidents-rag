fforts.[88][89][90] A Bush sound bite, referring to the issue of overarching purpose as "the vision thing", has become a metonym applied to other political figures accused of similar difficulties.[91][92][93][94][95][96] His ability to gain broad international support for the Gulf War and the war's result were seen as both a diplomatic and military triumph,[97] rousing bipartisan approval,[98] though his decision to withdraw without removing Saddam Hussein left mixed feelings, and attention returned to the domestic front and a souring economy.[99] A New York Times article mistakenly depicted Bush as being surprised to see a supermarket barcode reader;[100][101] the report of his reaction exacerbated the notion that he was "out of touch".[100]
Bush was popular throughout most of his presidency. After the Gulf war concluded in February 1991, his approval rating saw a high of 89 percent, before gradually declining for the rest of the year, and eventually falling below 50 percent according to a January 1992 Gallup poll.[102][103][104] His sudden drop in his favorability was likely due to the early 1990s recession, which shifted his image from "conquering hero" to "politician befuddled by economic matters".[105] At the elite level, several commentators and political experts lamented the state of American politics in 1991â€“1992 and reported the voters were angry. Many analysts blamed the poor quality of national election campaigns.[106]
