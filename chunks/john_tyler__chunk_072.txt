not attempt to justify it, he never freed any of his slaves. Tyler considered slavery a part of states' rights, and that therefore the federal government lacked the authority to abolish it. The living conditions of his slaves are not well documented, but historians surmise that he cared for their well-being and abstained from physical violence against them.[6] In December 1841, Tyler was attacked by the abolitionist publisher Joshua Leavitt, with the unsubstantiated allegation that Tyler had fathered several sons with his slaves, and later sold them. A number of black families today maintain a belief in their descent from Tyler, but there is no evidence of such genealogy.[7] At least four of his sons served in the government or military forces of the Confederacy; Robert Tyler Jones, his grandson by his daughter Mary, joined Company K of the 53rd Virginia Infantry Regiment on 25 June 1861, and was wounded on 3 July 1863 while taking part in Pickett's Charge as a color-bearer in the Army of Northern Virginia during the Battle of Gettysburg.[8]
Tyler's personal net worth is estimated to have exceeded $50 million when adjusting for inflation by modern standards (according to peak valuation circa 2020), but he became indebted during the Civil War, and died with a greatly reduced fortune.[9]
