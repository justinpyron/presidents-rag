cause of his race and allowed the use of federal troops to supervise elections. Bayard supported the effort, which passed both houses and sent to the President.[43] Hayes was determined to preserve the law to protect black voters, and he vetoed the appropriation.[42] Bayard spoke in favor of the bill, believing the time had come to end the military's involvement in Southern politics.[43] The Democrats did not have enough votes to override the veto, but they passed a new bill with the same rider. Hayes vetoed this as well, and the process was repeated three times more.[42] Finally, Hayes signed an appropriation without the rider, but Congress refused to pass another bill to fund federal marshals, who were vital to the enforcement of the Force Acts.[42] The election laws remained in effect, but the funds to enforce them were cut off.[42]
Bayard also clashed with Hayes on the issue of Chinese immigration. In 1868, the Senate had ratified the Burlingame Treaty with China, allowing an unrestricted flow of Chinese immigrants into the country. Bayard criticized the treaty because it treated Americans and the Chinese as equal races, when he believed the latter was inferior.[44] As the economy soured after the Panic of 1873, Chinese immigrants were blamed for depressing workmen's wages.[45] During the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, anti-Chinese riots broke out in San Francisco, and a third party, the Workingman's Party, was formed with an emphasis on stopping Chinese immigration.[45]
