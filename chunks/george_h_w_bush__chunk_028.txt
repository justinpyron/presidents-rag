Bush defeated Dukakis by a margin of 426 to 111 in the Electoral College, and he took 53.4 percent of the national popular vote.[41] Bush ran well in all the major regions of the country, but especially in the South.[42] He became the fourth sitting vice president to be elected president and the first to do so since Martin Van Buren in 1836 and the first person to succeed a president from his own party via election since Herbert Hoover in 1929.[1][a] In the concurrent congressional elections, Democrats retained control of both houses of Congress.[44]
