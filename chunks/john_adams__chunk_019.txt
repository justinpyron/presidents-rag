A delegation consisting of Adams, Franklin, and Edward Rutledge met with Howe at the Staten Island Peace Conference on September 11.[40][41] Howe's authority was premised on the states' submission, so the parties found no common ground. When Lord Howe stated he could view the American delegates only as British subjects, Adams replied, "Your lordship may consider me in what light you please, ... except that of a British subject."[42] Adams learned many years later that his name was on a list of people specifically excluded from Howe's pardon-granting authority.[43] Adams was unimpressed with Howe and predicted American success.[44] He was able to return home to Braintree in October before leaving in January 1777 to resume his duties in Congress.[45]
