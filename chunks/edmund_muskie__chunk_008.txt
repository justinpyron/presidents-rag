e brought together a variety of the political elite of Maine—notably Frank M. Coffin and Victor Hunt Harding—to plan a comeback for the party.[7] On February 8, 1951, Muskie resigned from the Maine House of Representatives to become acting director for the Maine Office of Price Stabilization. He moved to Portland soon after and was assigned the inflation-control and price-ceiling divisions.[8] His job required him to move across Maine to spread word about economic incentives which he used to increase his name recognition.[8] He served as the regional director at the Office of Price Stabilization from 1951 to 1952.[9] Upon leaving the Office he was asked to join the Democratic National Committee as a member; he served on the committee from 1952 to 1956.[9]
In April 1953, while working on renovations for his family home in Waterville, Muskie broke through a balcony railing, falling down two flights of stairs.[10] He landed on his back, knocked
unconscious. He was rushed to the hospital, where he remained unconscious for two days.[10] Doctors believed that Muskie was in a coma, so they gave him comatose-specific medication which caused him to regain consciousness but start to hallucinate.[11] Muskie tried to jump out of the hospital window, but was restrained by staff members. After a couple of months, through physical rehabilitation and corrective braces, he was able to walk once more.[12]
