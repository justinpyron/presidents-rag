Suffrage was expanded and a state Agricultural and Mechanical College (later to become Ohio State University) was established.[15] He also proposed a reduction in state taxes and reform of the state prison system.[16] Choosing not to seek reelection, Hayes looked forward to retiring from politics in 1872.[17]
Private life and return to politics
As Hayes prepared to leave office, several delegations of reform-minded Republicans urged him to run for United States Senate against the incumbent Republican, John Sherman.[17] Hayes declined, preferring to preserve party unity and retire to private life.[17] He especially looked forward to spending time with his children, two of whom (daughter Fanny and son Scott) had been born in the past five years.[18][a] Initially, Hayes tried to promote railway extensions to his hometown, Fremont. He also managed some real estate he had acquired in Duluth, Minnesota.[20] Not entirely removed from politics, Hayes held out some hope of a cabinet appointment, but was disappointed to receive only an appointment as assistant U.S. treasurer at Cincinnati, which he turned down.[21] He agreed to be nominated for his old House seat in 1872 but was disappointed when he lost the election
