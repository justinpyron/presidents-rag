 John D. Stevenson, Samuel S. Carroll, and Winfield S. Hancock.[26] Finally assigned to Carroll's staff again, McKinley acted as the general's first and only adjutant.[27]
Lee and his army surrendered to General Ulysses S. Grant a few days later, effectively ending the war. McKinley joined a Freemason lodge (later renamed after him) in Winchester, Virginia, before he and Carroll were transferred to Hancock's First Veterans Corps in Washington.[28] Just before the war's end, McKinley received his final promotion, a brevet commission as major.[29] In July, the Veterans Corps was mustered out of service, and McKinley and Carroll were relieved of their duties.[29] Carroll and Hancock encouraged McKinley to apply for a place in the peacetime army, but he declined and returned to Ohio the following month.[29]
McKinley, along with Samuel M. Taylor and James C. Howe, co-authored and published a twelve-volume work, Official Roster of the Soldiers of the State of Ohio in the War of the Rebellion, 1861â€“1866, published in 1886.[30]
Legal career and marriage

After the war ended in 1865, McKinley decided on a career in the law and began studying in the office of an attorney in Poland, Ohio.[1] The following year, he continued his studies by attending Albany Law School in New York state.[2] After studying there for less than a year, McKinley returned home and in March 1867 was admitted to the bar in Warren, Ohio.[2]
That same year, he moved to Canton, the county seat of Stark County, Ohio,
