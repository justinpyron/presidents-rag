Reagan attended Dixon High School, where he developed interests in drama and football.[11] His first job involved working as a lifeguard at the Rock River in Lowell Park.[12] In 1928, Reagan began attending Eureka College[13] at Nelle's approval on religious grounds.[14] He was a mediocre student[15] who participated in sports, drama, and campus politics. He became student body president and joined a student strike that resulted in the college president's resignation.[16] Reagan was initiated as a member of Tau Kappa Epsilon Fraternity and served as president of the local chapter.[17] Reagan played at the guard position for the 1930 and 1931 Eureka Red Devils football teams and recalled a time when two black football teammates were refused service at a segregated hotel; he invited them to his parents' home nearby in Dixon and his parents welcomed them. At the time, his parents' stance on racial questions was unusually progressive in Dixon.[18] Reagan himself had grown up with very few black Americans there and was oblivious to racial discrimination.[19]
