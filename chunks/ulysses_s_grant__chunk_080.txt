 the company's bank vault.[24] When the trades went bad, multiple loans came due, all backed by the same collateral.[25]
Historians agree that the elder Grant was likely unaware of Ward's intentions, but it is unclear how much Buck Grant knew. In May 1884, enough investments went bad to convince Ward that the firm would soon be bankrupt. Ward, who assumed Grant was "a child in business matters",[26] told him of the impending failure, but assured Grant that this was a temporary shortfall.[27] Grant approached businessman William Henry Vanderbilt, who gave him a personal loan of $150,000.[28] Grant invested the money in the firm, but it was not enough to save it. The fall of Grant & Ward set off the Panic of 1884.[25]
Vanderbilt offered to forgive Grant's debt entirely, but Grant refused.[29] Impoverished but compelled by personal honor, he repaid what he could with his Civil War mementos and the sale or transfer of all other assets.[30] Vanderbilt took title to Grant's home, although he allowed the Grants to continue to reside there, and pledged to donate the souvenirs to the federal government and insisted the debt had been paid in full.[31] Grant was distraught over Ward's deception and asked privately how he could ever "trust any human being again."[32] In March 1885, he testified against both Ward and Fish.[33] After the collapse of Grant & Ward, there was an outpouring of sympathy for Grant.[34]
