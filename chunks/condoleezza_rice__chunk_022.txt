As Secretary of State, Rice traveled heavily and initiated many diplomatic efforts on behalf of the Bush administration;[9] she holds the record for most miles logged in the position.[10] Her diplomacy relied on strong presidential support and is considered to be the continuation of style defined by former Republican secretaries of state Henry Kissinger and James Baker.[9]
Postâ€“Bush administration
After the end of the Bush Administration, Rice returned to academia and joined the Council on Foreign Relations.[1]
Public appearances and commentary
In October 2010, Rice met with President Obama for a discussion on national security issues.[2][3] In November, Rice participated in the groundbreaking of the George W. Bush Presidential Center.[4][5] Two years later, Rice introduced world leaders such as Tony Blair and Jose Maria Aznar at the center's dedication ceremony.[6]
In May 2011, after the killing of Osama bin Laden, Rice told Zain Verjee that bin Laden's death was "gratifying because for our country this brings an important chapter to a close and it shows that the United States can, with patience and persistence, do something like this." She argued against removing troops from Afghanistan until the US finished helping the country "get more decent governance".[7] That year, she appeared as herself on the NBC sitcom 30 Rock in the fifth-season episode "Everything Sunny All the Time Always", in which she engages in a classical-music duel with Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin).
