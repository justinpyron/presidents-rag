sham attended Indiana University Bloomington for a year beginning in September 1851, then returned to Corydon to read law with judge William A. Porter. He was admitted to the bar on April 1, 1854, and entered private practice with Thomas C. Slaughter.[2][4][5]
Gresham quickly became involved in politics as an opponent of slavery, advocating for gradual, peaceful abolition. He ran unsuccessfully for Harrison County clerk in 1853.[2] He joined the nativist American Party in 1855 before quickly joining the new Republican Party in 1856 and actively campaigning for the party's ticket. In 1860, he was elected to the Indiana House of Representatives as a Republican in a strongly Democratic district.[6] Though Stephen A. Douglas carried Harrison County in the presidential election, Gresham won by sixty votes.[7]
Gresham's first act in the House was to introduce a resolution declaring armed resistance to constitutional laws by Congress as treason; though the word "treason" was ultimately removed, Gresham's resolution passed.[8] He was also a strong critic of the spoils system.[2]
Gresham received a commission as a colonel on the staff of Oliver P. Morton, but their relationship was strained.[8] As chair of the House Committee on Military Affairs, he was the author of a bill transferring power to commission militia officers to the governor; their office had previously been elected.[2] Gresham asked Morton for such a commission but was refused.[8]
