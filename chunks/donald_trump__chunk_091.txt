tion throughout his career, sustaining a "love-hate" relationship with the press.[56] In the 2016 campaign, Trump benefited from a record amount of free media coverage, elevating his standing in the Republican primaries.[57] The New York Times writer Amy Chozick wrote in 2018 that Trump's media dominance enthralled the public and created "must-see TV".[58]
As a candidate and as president, Trump frequently accused the press of bias, calling it the "fake news media" and "the enemy of the people".[59][60] In 2018, journalist Lesley Stahl said that Trump had privately told her that he intentionally discredited the media "so when you write negative stories about me no one will believe you".[61]
As president, Trump mused about revoking the press credentials of journalists he viewed as critical.[62] His administration moved to revoke the press passes of two White House reporters, which were restored by the courts.[63] The Trump White House held about a hundred formal press briefings in 2017, declining by half during 2018 and to two in 2019.[63]
Trump also deployed the legal system to intimidate the press.[64] In early 2020, the Trump campaign sued The New York Times, The Washington Post, and CNN for defamation in opinion pieces about Russian election interference.[65][66] All the suits were dismissed.[67][68][69]
