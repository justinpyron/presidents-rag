rom May 14, 1981, to January 26, 1982, Eagleburger was assistant secretary of state for European affairs.[1] In 1982, Reagan appointed him as undersecretary of state for political affairs (the State Department's third-ranking position), a position he held for several years. He attained the rank of Career Ambassador in the Senior Foreign Service on April 12, 1984.[3] He then became president of Kissinger Associates, a consultancy firm which provided firms with advice on international politics.[4] In 1989, President George H. W. Bush appointed him deputy secretary of state (the department's second-ranking position); he also served as the President's primary advisor for affairs relating to the quickly disintegrating Yugoslavia. On August 23, 1992, James Baker resigned as secretary of state (to manage Bush's unsuccessful re-election campaign), and Eagleburger served as acting secretary of state until Bush gave him a recess appointment for the remainder of the Bush administration.
His period as advisor for Yugoslavian affairs from 1989 to 1992 was controversial as he gained a reputation for being a strong Serbian partisan. This perceived partisanship led the European press to dub him Lawrence of Serbia[5] (a reference to Lawrence of Arabia). Eagleburger had controversial ties to Yugoslavia both in promoting loans to Yugoslavia as a government official and later serving on the board of a Yugoslav-government-owned LBS Bank (Ljubljanska Banka) as well as with Yugo Motors, USA.[6] Abo
