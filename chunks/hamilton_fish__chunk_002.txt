New York political career
U.S. Congress
For eight years after his defeat as a Representative in the New York State Assembly, Fish was reluctant to run for office.[1] However, Whig party leaders in 1842 convinced him to run for the House of Representatives.[1] In November, Fish was elected to the House of Representatives; having defeated Democrat John McKeon and serving in the 28th Congress from New York's 6th District between 1843 and 1845.[1] The Whigs at this time were in the minority in the House; however, Fish gained valued national experience serving on the Committee of Military Affairs.[1] Fish failed to win a re-election bid for a second term in the House.[2]
Lieutenant governor
Fish was the Whig candidate for Lieutenant Governor of New York in 1846, but was defeated by Democrat Addison Gardiner who had been endorsed by the Anti-Rent Party.[3] Leasing farmers in New York refused to pay rent to large land tract owners and sometimes resorted to violence and intimidation.[3] Fish had opposed the Anti-Rent Party for the use of illegal tactics not to pay rent.[3][2] Gardiner was elected in May 1847 a judge of the New York Court of Appeals and vacated the office of lieutenant governor.[3] Fish was then in November 1847 elected to fill the vacancy, and was Lieutenant Governor in 1848.[3] Lieut. Gov. Fish had a favorable reputation for being "conciliatory" and for his "firmness" over the New York Senate.[4]
