porters of the Foundation, and his Secret Service detail traveled on every leg of every trip. [...] He's not spoken to Epstein in well over a decade."[81][87][88]
However, later reports showed that Clinton had flown on Epstein's plane 26 times.[89] In another statement Clinton said "one meeting with Epstein in his Harlem office in 2002, and around the same time made one brief visit to Epstein's New York apartment with a staff member and his security detail". In July 2019 it was reported that Clinton attended a dinner with Epstein in 1995, a meeting with Epstein that Clinton had not previously disclosed.[90]
Clinton reportedly used Epstein's private jet to visit Little St. James Island, where Epstein resided,[91] on multiple occasions between 2002 and 2005.[92] Virginia Roberts, later known as Virginia Giuffre, says in a lawsuit that while working at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort[93] she was lured into a sex-trafficking ring run by Epstein and while traveling with Epstein she saw Clinton on the island.[94] In a 2011 conversation with her lawyers, Roberts stated that Clinton traveled to Epstein's retreat on Little St. James in 2002.[95] According to Roberts, Epstein told her that Clinton "owes me favors" when she asked what he was doing there.[96] She also reportedly claimed that Epstein and Clinton had dined in the presence of two girls aged approximately seventeen whom she believed Epstein had invited to have sex with Clinton, but that Clinton showed no interest in them.[9
