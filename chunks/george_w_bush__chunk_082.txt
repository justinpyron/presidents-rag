compared to 46 percent unfavorably.[25] Other pollsters have noted similar trends of slight improvement  in Bush's personal favorability since the end of his presidency.[26] In April 2013, Bush's approval rating stood at 47 percent approval and 50 percent disapproval in a poll jointly conducted for The Washington Post and ABC, his highest approval rating since December 2005.[27] Bush had achieved notable gains among seniors, non-college whites, and moderate and conservative Democrats since leaving office, although majorities disapproved of his handling of the economy (53 percent) and the Iraq War (57 percent).[28] His 47 percent approval rating was equal to that of President Obama's in the same polling period.[27] A CNN poll conducted that same month found that 55 percent of Americans said Bush's presidency had been a failure, with opinions divided along party lines, and 43 percent of independents calling it a success.[29] Bush's public image saw greater improvement in 2017, with a YouGov survey showing 51 percent of favorability from Democrats.[30] A 2018 CNN poll subsequently found that 61 percent of respondents held of a favorable view of Bush, an increase of nine points from 2015.[31] The improvement has been interpreted as Democrats viewing him more favorably in response to Donald Trump's first presidency,[32][33][34] an assessment that has also been expressed by Bush himself.[35]
