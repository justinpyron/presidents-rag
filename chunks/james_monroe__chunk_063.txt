ships in New Jersey, and Fort Monroe are all named for him. Monroe has been depicted on U.S. currency and stamps, including a 1954 United States Postal Service 5Â¢ Liberty Issue postage stamp.[6]
Monroe was the last U.S. president to wear a powdered wig tied in a queue, a tricorne hat and knee-breeches according to the style of the late 18th century.[7][8] That earned him the nickname "The Last Cocked Hat". He was also the last president who was not photographed.[9]
His participation in George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River and the Battle of Trenton was memorialized in Emanuel Leutze's 1851 painting Washington Crossing the Delaware as well as John Trumbull's painting The Capture of the Hessians at Trenton, December 26, 1776.[10]
