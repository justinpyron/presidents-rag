Early life and career
Main article: Early life and career of Thomas Jefferson
Jefferson was born on April 13, 1743 (April 2, 1743, Old Style, Julian calendar), at the family's Shadwell Plantation in the British Colony of Virginia, the third of ten children.[1] He was of English and possibly Welsh descent, and was born a British subject.[2] His father, Peter Jefferson, was a planter and surveyor who died when Jefferson was fourteen; his mother was Jane Randolph.[a] Peter Jefferson moved his family to Tuckahoe Plantation in 1745 on the death of William Randolph III, the plantation's owner and Jefferson's friend, who in his will had named Peter guardian of Randolph's children. The Jeffersons returned to Shadwell before October 1753.[4]
Peter died in 1757, and his estate was divided between his sons Thomas and Randolph.[5] John Harvie Sr. became 13-year-old Thomas' guardian.[6] Thomas inherited approximately 5,000 acres (2,000 ha; 7.8 sq mi), which included Monticello, and he assumed full legal authority over the property at age 21.[7]
Education and early family life
Jefferson began his education together with the Randolph children at Tuckahoe under tutors.[8] Thomas' father Peter, who was self-taught and regretted not having a formal education, entered Thomas into an English school
