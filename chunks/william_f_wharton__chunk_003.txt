He and his wife had a summer home in Groton, where they socialized with members of Boston's most influential families.[2] Wharton died at his Boston home, on May 20, 1919, at the age of 72.[3] Despite being very influential in local politics in Massachusetts in the 1880s and 1890s, today it is all but forgotten: a Boston Globe article in January 2013 noted that "Some of the even more obscure [Secretaries of State] include William F. Wharton, who was acting secretary of state twice in the early 1890s. He is so forgotten that he does not even have his own Wikipedia page."[4]  But although Wharton remains relatively unknown, at least now, he does have his own Wikipedia entry.
