 alleged by whistle-blowers.[62][63] The investigation continued after his firing, and the review report was released in April 2021. The review had found more than 100 instances of misconduct where Pompeo requested that State Department staff perform personal errands for him and his wife,[64] "from booking salon appointments and private dinner reservations to picking up their dog and arranging tours for the Pompeos' political allies."[65] The inspector general concluded that the behavior was inconsistent with regulations [66][65][67] and "recommended that various divisions at the State Department, such as the Office of the Legal Adviser, update or draft new guidance that establishes or further clarifies the appropriate use of department funds and staffers when it comes to personal tasks."[65][68]
The inspector general had also investigated Pompeo's role in the Trump administration's decision to declare an "emergency" to bypass a congressional freeze on arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Prior to his firing, Linick had requested an interview with Pompeo, which Pompeo had declined.[69] After Linick's firing, it was also revealed that he was investigating claims that a top Pompeo aide had failed to report allegations of workplace violence.[70] Pompeo denied that he sought to fire Linick in retaliation.[61]
