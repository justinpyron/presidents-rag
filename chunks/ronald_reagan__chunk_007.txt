er succeeded him as SAG president.[37]
Marriages and children
In January 1940, Reagan married Jane Wyman, his co-star in the 1938 film Brother Rat.[38][39] Together, they had two biological daughters: Maureen in 1941,[40] and Christine in 1947 (born prematurely and died the following day).[41] They adopted one son, Michael, in 1945.[21] Wyman filed to divorce Reagan in June 1948. She was uninterested in politics, and occasionally recriminated, reconciled and separated with him. Although Reagan was unprepared,[41] the divorce was finalized in July 1949. Reagan would also remain close to his children.[42] Later that year, Reagan met Nancy Davis after she contacted him in his capacity as the SAG president about her name appearing on a communist blacklist in Hollywood; she had been mistaken for another Nancy Davis.[43] They married in March 1952,[44] and had two children, Patti in October 1952, and Ron in May 1958.[45] Reagan has three grandchildren.[46]
Television
Reagan became the host of MCA Inc. television production General Electric Theater[15] at Wasserman's recommendation. It featured multiple guest stars,[47] and Ronald and Nancy Reagan, continuing to use her stage name Nancy Davis, acted together in three episodes.[48] When asked how Reagan was able to recruit such stars to appear on the show during television's infancy, he replied, "Good stories, top direction, production quality".[49] However, the viewership declined in the 1960s and the show was canceled in 1962.[50]
