Public support for greenbacks had grown, especially among businesspeople who thought withdrawal would lead to lower prices.[45] When a bill passed the House suspending the authority to retire greenbacks under the Contraction Act, Sherman supported it in the Senate.[45] It passed the Senate 33–4, and became law in 1868.[45]
In the next Congress, among the first bills to pass the house was the Public Credit Act of 1869, which would require the government to pay bondholders in gold, not greenbacks.[45] The 1868 election campaign had seen the Democrats proposing to repay the bondholders (mostly supporters of the Union war effort) in paper; Republicans favored gold, as the bonds had been purchased with gold.[45] Sherman agreed with his fellow Republicans and voted with them to pass the bill 42–13.[46] Sherman continued to favor wider circulation of the greenback when he voted for the Currency Act of 1870, which authorized an additional $54 million in United States Notes.[45] Sherman
