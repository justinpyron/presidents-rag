In May 2002, Obama commissioned a poll to assess his prospects in a 2004 U.S. Senate race. He created a campaign committee, began raising funds, and lined up political media consultant David Axelrod by August 2002. Obama formally announced his candidacy in January 2003.[16]
Obama was an early opponent of the George W. Bush administration's 2003 invasion of Iraq.[17] On October 2, 2002, the day President Bush and Congress agreed on the joint resolution authorizing the Iraq War,[18] Obama addressed the first high-profile Chicago anti-Iraq War rally,[19] and spoke out against the war.[20] He addressed another anti-war rally in March 2003 and told the crowd "it's not too late" to stop the war.[21]
Decisions by Republican incumbent Peter Fitzgerald and his Democratic predecessor Carol Moseley Braun not to participate in the election resulted in wide-open Democratic and Republican primary contests involving 15 candidates.[22] In the March 2004 primary election, Obama won in an unexpected landslideâ€”which overnight made him a rising star within the national Democratic Party, started speculation about a presidential future, and led to the reissue of his memoir, Dreams from My Father.[23] In July 2004, Obama delivered the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention,[24] seen by nine million viewers. His speech was well received and elevated his status within the Democratic Party.[25]
