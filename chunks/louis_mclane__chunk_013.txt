McLane died in Baltimore, Maryland and is buried in Green Mount Cemetery.
McLane's biographer, Professor John A. Munroe, described him as follows: [T]he problem was that few people could love Louis McLane... He was intelligent and able, clear-minded and efficient, but to the average man and even to some of his children, he was not lovable. He was almost sinfully ambitious, as his father had encouraged him to be. He was often meanly suspicious, and life had encouraged him to be ever mindful of his welfare and that of the large family dependent on him. He was easily affronted and held grudges almost with glee against those who crossed him. He was immensely persuasive, but in the long run he abandoned in disgust each of the successive scenes of his triumphs. It was to Kitty and the children that he was true, and the children learned to admire but not to love this stern, busy, handsome, sensitive man.[1]
He owned the Zachariah Ferris House, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.[2][3]  His own house, the Louis McLane House, was listed in 1973.[3]
