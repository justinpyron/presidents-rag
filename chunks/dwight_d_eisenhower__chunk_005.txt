 being tackled in the next game, which was the last he played; he reinjured his knee on horseback and in the boxing ring,[5][7][25] so he turned to fencing and gymnastics.[5]
Eisenhower later served as junior varsity football coach and cheerleader, which caught the attention of General Frederick Funston.[26] He graduated from West Point in the middle of the class of 1915,[27] which became known as "the class the stars fell on", because 59 members eventually became general officers. After graduation in 1915, Second Lieutenant Eisenhower requested an assignment in the Philippines, which was denied; because of the ongoing Mexican Revolution, he was posted to Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas, under the command of General Funston. In 1916, while stationed at Fort Sam Houston, Funston convinced him to become the football coach for Peacock Military Academy;[26] he later became the coach at St. Louis College, now St. Mary's University,[28] and was an honorary member of the Sigma Beta Chi fraternity there.[29]

While Eisenhower was stationed in Texas, he met Mamie Doud of Boone, Iowa.[1] They were immediately taken with each other. He proposed to her on Valentine's Day in 1916.[2] A November wedding date in Denver was moved up to July 1 due to the impending American entry into World War I; Funston approved 10 days of leave for their wedding.[3] The Eisenhowers moved many times during their first 35 years of marriage.[4]
