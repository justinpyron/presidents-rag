ontal attack as he had done at Cold Harbor, Grant continued to force Lee to extend his defenses south and west of Petersburg, better allowing him to capture essential railroad links.[120]
Union forces soon captured Mobile Bay and Atlanta and now controlled the Shenandoah Valley, ensuring Lincoln's reelection in November.[127] Sherman convinced Grant and Lincoln to allow his army to march on Savannah.[128] Sherman cut a 60-mile (97Â km) path of destruction unopposed, reached the Atlantic Ocean, and captured Savannah on December 22.[129] On December 16, after much prodding by Grant, the Union Army under Thomas smashed John Bell Hood's Confederates at Nashville.[130] These campaigns left Lee's forces at Petersburg as the only significant obstacle remaining to Union victory.[131]
By March 1865, Lee was trapped and his strength severely weakened.[132] He was running out of reserves to replace the high battlefield casualties and remaining Confederate troops, no longer having confidence in their commander and under the duress of trench warfare, deserted by the thousands.[133] On March 25, in a desperate effort, Lee sacrificed his remaining troops (4,000 Confederate casualties) at Fort Stedman, a Union victory and the last Petersburg line battle.
