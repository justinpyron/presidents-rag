The Library of Congress maintains a collection of Colbyâ€™s documents.[8]
Later career
After leaving office as secretary of state, Colby continued to practice law for the remainder of his career. As an attorney, Colby accepted Woodrow Wilson as a partner after the latter's presidency; Colby left that firm in 1923. Earlier in his career, Colby's most notable client was Mark Twain. Colby addressed the fractious 1924 Democratic National Convention as the chief spokesman for the minority of delegates that unsuccessfully sought a platform plank denouncing the then-powerful Ku Klux Klan by name.[9]
Colby was a prominent member of the American Liberty League, a group of wealthy, anti-New Deal Democrats. He eventually supported the Republican candidate, Alf Landon, over Franklin Roosevelt in 1936.[10]
