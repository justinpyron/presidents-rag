False or misleading statements
Main article: False or misleading statements by Donald Trump
As a candidate and as president, Trump frequently made false statements in public remarks[4][5] to an extent unprecedented in American politics.[4][6][7] His falsehoods became a distinctive part of his political identity.[6]
Trump's false and misleading statements were documented by fact-checkers, including at The Washington Post, which tallied 30,573 false or misleading statements made by Trump over his four-year term.[1] Trump's falsehoods increased in frequency over time, rising from about six false or misleading claims per day in his first year as president to 39 per day in his final year.[8]
Some of Trump's falsehoods were inconsequential, such as his repeated claim of the "biggest inaugural crowd ever".[9][10] Others had more far-reaching effects, such as his promotion of antimalarial drugs as an unproven treatment for COVID-19,[11][12] causing a U.S. shortage of these drugs and panic-buying in Africa and South Asia.[13][14] Other misinformation, such as misattributing a rise in crime in England and Wales to the "spread of radical Islamic terror", served Trump's domestic political purposes.[15] Trump habitually does not apologize for his falsehoods.[16]
Until 2018, the media rarely referred to Trump's falsehoods as lies, including when he repeated demonstrably false statements.[17][18][19]
