Early life and career
Main article: Early life and career of Barack Obama
Barack Obama was born on August 4, 1961,[1] at Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children in Honolulu, Hawaii.[2][3][4][5] He is the only president born outside the contiguous 48 states.[6] He was born to an 18-year-old American mother and a 27-year-old Kenyan father. His mother, Ann Dunham (1942–1995), was born in Wichita, Kansas, and was of English, Welsh, German, Swiss, and Irish descent. In 2007 it was discovered her great-great-grandfather Falmouth Kearney emigrated from the village of Moneygall, Ireland to the U.S. in 1850.[7] In July 2012, Ancestry.com found a strong likelihood that Dunham was descended from John Punch, an enslaved African man who lived in the Colony of Virginia during the seventeenth century.[8][9][10] Obama's father, Barack Obama Sr. (1934–1982),[11][12] was a married[13][14][15] Luo Kenyan from Nyang'oma Kogelo.[13][16] His last name, Obama, was derived from his Luo descent.[17] Obama's parents met in 1960 in a Russian language class at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, where his father was a foreign student on a scholarship.[18][19] The couple married in Wailuku, Hawaii, on February 2, 1961, six months before Obama was born.[20][21]
