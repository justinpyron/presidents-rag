Rodham's early political development was shaped mostly by her high school history teacher (like her father, a fervent anti-communist), who introduced her to Goldwater's The Conscience of a Conservative and by her Methodist youth minister (like her mother, concerned with issues of social justice), with whom she saw and afterwards briefly met civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. at a 1962 speech in Chicago's Orchestra Hall.[20]
Wellesley College years
In 1965, Rodham enrolled at Wellesley College, where she majored in political science.[21][22] During her first year, she was president of the Wellesley Young Republicans.[23][24] As the leader of this "Rockefeller Republican"-oriented group,[25] she supported the elections of moderate Republicans John Lindsay to mayor of New York City and Massachusetts attorney general Edward Brooke to the United States Senate.[26] She later stepped down from this position.
