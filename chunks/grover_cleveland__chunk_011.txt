41] Despite the initial popularity of the fare-reduction bill, the newspapers praised Cleveland's veto.[41] Theodore Roosevelt, then a member of the Assembly, had reluctantly voted for the bill with the intention of holding railroad barons accountable.[42] After the veto, Roosevelt and other legislators reversed their position, and Cleveland's veto was sustained.[42]
Cleveland's defiance of political corruption won him popular acclaim. Yet it also brought the enmity of New York City's influential Tammany Hall organization and its boss, John Kelly.[43] Tammany Hall and Kelly had disapproved of Cleveland's nomination for governor, and their resistance intensified after Cleveland openly opposed and prevented the re-election of Thomas F. Grady, their point man in the State Senate.[44] Cleveland also steadfastly opposed other Tammany nominees, as well as bills passed as a result of their deal-making.[45] The loss of Tammany's support was offset by the support of Theodore Roosevelt and other reform-minded Republicans, who helped Cleveland pass several laws to reform municipal governments.[46] Cleveland closely worked with Roosevelt, who served as assembly minority leader in 1883; the municipal legislation they cooperated on gained Cleveland national recognition.[47]
