In 1838, Jackson became an official member of the First Presbyterian Church in Nashville.[19] Both his mother and his wife had been devout Presbyterians all their lives, but Jackson stated that he had postponed officially entering the church until after his retirement to avoid accusations that he had done so for political reasons.[20]

Jackson's legacy is controversial and polarizing.[1][2][3] His contemporary, Alexis de Tocqueville, depicted him as the spokesperson of the majority and their passions.[4] He has been variously described as a frontiersman personifying the independence of the American West,[5] a slave-owning member of the Southern gentry,[6] and a populist who promoted faith in the wisdom of the ordinary citizen.[7] He has been represented as a statesman who substantially advanced the spirit of democracy[8] and upheld the foundations of American constitutionalism,[9] as well as an autocratic demagogue who crushed political opposition and trampled the law.[10]
