the 1908 U.S. presidential election.
U.S. Secretary of State
In February 1909, President-elect William Howard Taft nominated Senator Knox to be Secretary of State.[2] He was at first found to be constitutionally ineligible, because Congress had increased the salary for the post during his Senate term, thus violating the Ineligibility Clause.[3] In particular, Knox had been elected to serve the term from March 4, 1905 to March 3, 1911. During debate on legislation approved on February 26, 1907, as well as debate beginning on March 4, 1908, he had consistently supported pay raises for the Cabinet, which were eventually instituted for the 1908 fiscal calendar.[3][4] The discovery of the constitutional complication came as a surprise after President-elect Taft had announced his intention to nominate Knox.[3]
The Senate Judiciary Committee proposed the remedy of resetting the salary to its pre-service level, and the Senate passed it unanimously on February 11, 1909.[4] Members of the U.S. House of Representatives mounted more opposition to the relief measure and defeated it once. After a special procedural rule was applied, the measure was passed by a 173â€“115 vote.[5] On March 4, 1909, the salary of the Secretary of State position was reverted from $12,000 to $8,000, and Knox took office on March 6.[3][4]  Later known as the "Saxbe fix", such legislation has been passed in a number of similar circumstances.
Knox served as Secretary of State in Taft's cabinet until March 5, 1913. A
