Bacon referred to his early months at J.P. Morgan as "really working for perhaps the first time in my life," as the firm was engaged in Morgan's plan to restore the credit of the United States government following the Panic of 1893.[1]
On February 5, 1895, he and Morgan met with President Grover Cleveland at the White House, where Morgan urged the private sale of government bonds in exchange for gold to an international syndicate represented by J.P. Morgan & Co. At the time, the United States Treasury was the subject of a bank run and on the verge of exhausting its gold reserves. Morgan prevailed upon Cleveland to agree to the private placement, in which Morgan's bank would act as representative of an international syndicate to supply sufficient gold.[1] Although Congress failed to pass a bill explicitly granting Cleveland the authority to make such a sale, he finalized the agreement with Morgan on February 8, avoiding the suspension of payments.[1]
The deal was politically controversial for all involved, but Bacon's role in managing the transaction earned him appreciation from Morgan; in the future, Bacon would manage all of Morgan's American business while the latter was in Europe.[1]
