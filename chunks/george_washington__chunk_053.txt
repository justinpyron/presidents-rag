 his position in December 1793, and Washington forsook him.[41]
The feud led to the well-defined Federalist and Republican parties, and party affiliation became necessary for election to Congress by 1794.[42] Washington remained aloof from congressional attacks on Hamilton, but did not publicly protect him. The Hamiltonâ€“Reynolds sex scandal opened Hamilton to disgrace, but Washington continued to hold him in "very high esteem".[43]
Whiskey Rebellion
Main article: Whiskey Rebellion
In March 1791, at Hamilton's urging, with support from Madison, Congress imposed an excise tax on distilled spirits to help curtail the national debt, which took effect in July.[44] Grain farmers strongly protested in Pennsylvania's frontier districts; they argued that they were unrepresented and were shouldering too much of the debt, comparing their situation to British taxation pre-Revolution.
On August 2, Washington assembled his cabinet to discuss the situation. Unlike Washington, who had reservations about using force, Hamilton was eager to suppress the rebellion with federal authority.[45] Wanting to avoid involving the federal government, Washington first called on Pennsylvania state officials to take the initiative, but they declined. On August 7, Washington issued his first proclamation for calling up state militias. After appealing for peace, he reminded the protestors that, unlike the rule of the British crown, the Federal law was issued by state-elected representatives.[46]
