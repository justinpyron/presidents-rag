The speech angered both Federalists, including Hamilton, many of whom had wanted a request for a declaration of war, and Republicans.[43] Hamilton secretly promoted a plan, already rejected by Adams, in which American and British troops would jointly seize Spanish Florida and Louisiana, ostensibly to deter a possible French invasion. Hamilton's critics, including Abigail, saw in his military buildups the signs of an aspiring military dictator.[44]
