Interstate commerce
For some time, there had been concern about the power of the railroads and the way they charged different rates for different customers.[33] In 1885, a bill to regulate the practice, authored by John Henninger Reagan of Texas passed the House. The Reagan bill forbade discrimination in railroad or pipeline freight rates, required that rates be reasonable, and fixed maximum charges allowed.[33] Sherman agreed with the general idea of the law, but objected to certain portions, especially a provision that gave state courts jurisdiction over enforcement disputes.[33] Sherman believed the law should allow for more nuance as well, insisting that competition against other forms of transit be considered.[34] These changes were adopted in the conference committee and the result, the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, owed much to Sherman's influence.[34] Cleveland signed it into law on February 4, 1887, and appointed members to the new Interstate Commerce Commission. The act displeased the railroad industry, but was a boon to farmers and the oil industry.[35]
