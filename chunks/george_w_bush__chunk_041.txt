Main article: War in Afghanistan (2001–2021)
On October 7, 2001, U.S. and British forces initiated bombing campaigns that led to the arrival of Northern Alliance troops in Kabul on November 13. The main goals of the war were to defeat the Taliban, drive al-Qaeda out of Afghanistan, and capture key al-Qaeda leaders. In December 2001, the Pentagon reported that the Taliban had been defeated,[157] but cautioned that the war would go on to continue weakening Taliban and al-Qaeda leaders.[157] Later that month the UN had installed the Afghan Transitional Administration chaired by Hamid Karzai.[158][159]
Efforts to kill or capture al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden failed as he escaped a battle in December 2001 in the mountainous region of Tora Bora, which the Bush Administration later acknowledged to have resulted from a failure to commit enough U.S. ground troops.[160] It was not until May 2011, two years after Bush left office, that bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces under the Obama administration.
Despite the initial success in driving the Taliban from power in Kabul, by early 2003 the Taliban was regrouping, amassing new funds and recruits.[161] The 2005 failure of Operation Red Wings showed that the Taliban had returned.[162] In 2006, the Taliban insurgency appeared larger, fiercer and better organized than expected, with large-scale allied offensives such as Operation Mountain Thrust attaining limited success.[16
