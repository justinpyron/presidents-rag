Arthur made appointments to fill two vacancies on the United States Supreme Court.

Arthur first nominated his old political boss, Roscoe Conkling; he doubted that Conkling would accept, but felt obligated to offer a high office to his former patron.[66] The Senate confirmed the nomination but, as expected, Conkling declined it,[66] the last time a confirmed nominee declined an appointment.[68] Senator George Edmunds was Arthur's next choice, but he declined to be considered.[69] Instead, Arthur nominated Samuel Blatchford, who had been a judge on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals for the prior four years.[66] Blatchford accepted, and his nomination was approved by the Senate within two weeks.[66] Blatchford served on the Court until his death in 1893.
