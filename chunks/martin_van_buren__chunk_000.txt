Early life and education
Further information: Family of Martin Van Buren

Martin Van Buren was born on December 5, 1782, in Kinderhook, New York,[1] about 20 miles (32 km) south of Albany in the Hudson River Valley.
His father, Abraham Van Buren, was a descendant of Cornelis Maessen, a native of Buurmalsen, Netherlands who had emigrated to New Netherland in 1631 and purchased a plot of land on Manhattan Island.[2][3] Along with being the first U.S. president who was not born a British subject, Van Buren was also the first U.S. president not of British ancestry; he was of entirely Dutch descent.[4][5] Abraham Van Buren had been a Patriot during the American Revolution,[6][7] and he later joined the Democratic-Republican Party.[8] He owned an inn and tavern in Kinderhook and served as Kinderhook's town clerk for several years. In 1776, he married Maria Hoes (or Goes) Van Alen (1746–1818) in the town of Kinderhook, also of Dutch extraction and the widow of Johannes Van Alen (1744-c. 1773). She had three children from her first marriage, including future U.S. Representative James I. Van Alen. Her second marriage produced five children, of which Martin was the third.[9]
Van Buren received a basic education at the village schoolhouse, and briefly studied Latin at the Kinderhook Academy
