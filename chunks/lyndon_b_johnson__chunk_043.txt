Our aim is not only to relieve the symptoms of poverty but to cure itâ€“and above all, to prevent it."[62] In April 1964, Johnson proposed the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, which would create the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) to oversee local Community Action Agencies (CAA) charged with dispensing aid to those in poverty.[63] Each CAA was required to have "maximum feasible participation" from local residents, who would design and operate antipoverty programs unique to their communities' needs.[64] This was threatening to local political regimes who saw CAAs as alternative power structures in their own communities, funded and encouraged by the OEO.[65][66][67] In 1967, the Green Amendment gave city governments the right to decide which entity would be the official CAA for their community.
