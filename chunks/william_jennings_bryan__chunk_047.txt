t we would choose the word 'sincerity' as fitting him [Bryan] most of all… it was that sincerity that served him so well in his life-long fight against sham and privilege and wrong.  It was that sincerity that made him a force for good in his own generation and kept alive many of the ancient faiths on which we are building today.  We… can well agree that he fought the good fight; that he finished the course; and that he kept the faith.[15]
More recently, conservative Republicans such as Ralph Reed have hailed Bryan's legacy. Reed described Bryan as "the most consequential evangelical politician of the twentieth century".[16] Bryan's career has also been compared to that of Donald Trump.[1]
In popular culture
It has been suggested by some economists, historians, and literary critics that L. Frank Baum satirized Bryan as the Cowardly Lion in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, which was published in 1900. Those assertions are based partly on Baum's history as a Republican supporter who advocated in his role as a journalist on behalf of William McKinley and his policies.[17][18][19]
Vachel Lindsay's 1919 "singing poem" "Bryan, Bryan, Bryan, Bryan" is a lengthy tribute to the idol of the poet's youth.
