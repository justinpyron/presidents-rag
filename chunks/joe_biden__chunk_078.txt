Biden has supported abortion rights throughout his presidency, though he personally opposes abortion because of his Catholic faith.[56][57] In 2019, he said he supported Roe v. Wade and repealing the Hyde Amendment.[58][59] After Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, he criticized near-total bans on abortion access passed in a majority of Republican-controlled states,[60] and took measures to protect abortion rights in the United States.[61] He has vowed to sign a bill codifying the protections of Roe into federal law; such a bill passed the House in 2022, but was unable to clear the Senate filibuster.[62][63]

Biden was consistently ranked one of the least wealthy members of the Senate,[1][2] which he attributed to having been elected young.[3] Feeling that less-wealthy public officials may be tempted to accept contributions in exchange for political favors, he proposed campaign finance reform measures during his first term.[4] As of November 2009[update], Biden's net worth was $27,012.[5] By November 2020[update], the Bidens were worth $9 million, largely due to sales of Biden's books and speaking fees after his vice presidency.[6][7]
Political columnist David S. Broder wrote that Biden has grown over time: "He responds to real people—that's been consistent throughout. And his ability to understand himself and deal with other politicians has gotten much, much better."[8] Journalis
