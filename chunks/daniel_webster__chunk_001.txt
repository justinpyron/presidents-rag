Phillips Exeter Academy, a preparatory school in Exeter, New Hampshire.[4] Exeter's Daniel Webster Debate Society, founded in 1818, is generally regarded as the oldest secondary school debate society in the nation. After studying the classics and other subjects for several months under a clergyman, Webster was admitted to Dartmouth College in 1797.[5]  During his time at Dartmouth, he managed the school newspaper and emerged as a strong public speaker.[6] He was chosen as the Fourth of July orator in the college town of Hanover in 1800, and his speech contained the substance of the political principles which he would later become famous for developing.[7] Like his father, and like many other New England farmers, Webster was firmly devoted to the Federalist Party and favored a strong central government.[8] He graduated from Dartmouth in 1801 and was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa honor society.[9]
After graduating from Dartmouth, he apprenticed under Salisbury lawyer Thomas W. Thompson.[10] Though unenthusiastic about studying the law, he believed that becoming a lawyer would allow him to "live comfortably" and avoid the bouts of poverty that had afflicted his father.[11] In order to help support his brother Ezekiel's study at Dartmouth, Webster temporarily resigned from the law office to work as a schoolteacher at Fryeburg Academy in Maine.[12] In 1804, he obtained a position in Boston under the prominent attorney Christopher Gore.
