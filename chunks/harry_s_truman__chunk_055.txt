rnment were believed by 78Â percent of the people in 1946 and became a major campaign issue for Eisenhower in 1952.[125] Truman was reluctant to take a more radical stance, because he felt it could threaten civil liberties and add to a potential hysteria. At the same time, he felt political pressure to indicate a strong national security.[126] It is unclear to what extent President Truman was briefed of the Venona intercepts, which discovered widespread evidence of Soviet espionage on the atom bomb project and afterward.[127][128] Truman continued his own loyalty program for some time while believing the issue of communist espionage was overstated.[127] In 1949, Truman described American communist leaders, whom his administration was prosecuting, as "traitors".[126] Truman would later state in private conversations with friends that his creation of a loyalty program had been a "terrible" mistake.[129]
In 1950, Truman vetoed the McCarran Internal Security Act, which was passed by Congress just after the start of the Korean War and was aimed at controlling communists in America.[130] Truman called the Act, "the greatest danger to freedom of speech, press, and assembly since the Alien and Sedition Laws of 1798," a "mockery of the Bill of Rights" and a "long step toward totalitarianism".[131][132] His veto was immediately overridden by Congress and the Act became law.[130] In the mid-1960s, parts of the Act were found to be unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court.[133]
