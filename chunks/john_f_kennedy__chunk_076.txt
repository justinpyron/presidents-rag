 at St. Matthew's Cathedral in Washington, D.C.[21] The Requiem Mass was led by Cardinal Richard Cushing, then the Archbishop of Boston.[21] It was attended by approximately 1,200 guests, including representatives from over 90 countries.[22][23] After the service, Kennedy was buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia.[24]
Personal life, family, and reputation
Further information: Kennedy family
The Kennedy family is one of the most established political families in the United States, having produced a president, three senators, three ambassadors, and multiple other representatives and politicians. While a congressman, Kennedy embarked on a seven-week trip to India, Japan, Vietnam, and Israel in 1951, at which point he became close with his then 25-year-old brother Robert, as well as his 27-year-old sister Patricia. Because they were several years apart in age, the brothers had previously seen little of each other. This 25,000-mile (40,000Â km) trip was the first extended time they had spent together and resulted in their becoming best friends.[1] Robert would eventually serve as his brother's attorney general and closest presidential advisor;[1] he would later run for president in 1968 before his assassination, while another Kennedy brother, Ted, ran for president in 1980.[2]
Wife and children
Kennedy met his wife, Jacqueline Lee "Jackie" Bouvier, when he was a congressman. Charles L. Bartlett, a journalist, introduced the pair at a dinner party.[3] T
