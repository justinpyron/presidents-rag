Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq
Main article: War on terror
Biden was a strong supporter of the War in Afghanistan, saying, "Whatever it takes, we should do it."[57] As head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he said in 2002 that Iraqi president Saddam Hussein was a threat to national security and there was no other option than to "eliminate" that threat.[58] In October 2002, he voted in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq, approving the U.S. invasion of Iraq.[52] As chair of the committee, he assembled a series of witnesses to testify in favor of the authorization. They gave testimony grossly misrepresenting the intent, history, and status of Saddam and his secular government, which was an avowed enemy of al-Qaeda, and touted Iraq's fictional possession of weapons of mass destruction.[59] Biden eventually became a critic of the war and called his vote and role a "mistake", but did not push for withdrawal.[52][55] He supported the appropriations for the occupation, but argued that the war should be internationalized, that more soldiers were needed, and that the Bush administration should "level with the American people" about its cost and length.[51][56]
By late 2006, Biden's stance had shifted considerably. He opposed the troop surge of 2007,[52][55] saying General David Petraeus was "dead, flat wrong" in believing the surge could work.[60] Biden instead advocated dividing Iraq into a loose federation of three ethnic states.[61] Rather t
