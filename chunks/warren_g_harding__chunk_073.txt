d in April 1922, Harding agreed to transfer control to the Veterans' Bureau.[23] Forbes' main task was to ensure that new hospitals were built around the country to help the 300,000 wounded World War I veterans.[24]
Near the beginning of 1922, Forbes had met Elias Mortimer, agent for the Thompson-Black Construction Company of St. Louis, which wanted to construct the hospitals. The two men became close, and Mortimer paid for Forbes' travels through the West, looking at potential hospital sites for the wounded World War I veterans. Forbes was also friendly with Charles F. Hurley, owner of the Hurley-Mason Construction Company of Washington state.[25] Harding had ordered that all contracts be pursuant to public notice,[26] but Forbes and the contractors worked out a deal whereby the two companies would get the contracts with the profits divided three ways. Some of the money went to the bureau's chief counsel, Charles F. Cramer.[25] Forbes defrauded the government, increasing construction costs from $3,000 to $4,000 per bed.[27] A tenth of the inflated construction billings was set aside for the conspirators, with Forbes receiving a third of the take.[28] The graft then spread to land acquisition, with Forbes authorizing the purchase of a San Francisco tract worth less than $20,000 for $105,000. At least $25,000 of the resulting financial excess was divided between Forbes and Cramer.[25]
Intent on making more money, Forbes in November 1922 began selling valuable hospital supplies
