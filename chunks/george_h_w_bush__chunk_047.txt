 offering federal support for a variety of innovations, such as open enrollment, incentive pay for outstanding teachers, and rewards for schools that improve performance with underprivileged children.[82] Though Bush did not pass a major educational reform package during his presidency, his ideas influenced later reform efforts, including Goals 2000 and the No Child Left Behind Act.[83] Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990,[84] which led to a 40 percent increase in legal immigration to the United States.[85] The act more than doubled the number of visas given to immigrants on the basis of job skills.[86] In the wake of the savings and loan crisis, Bush proposed a $50Â billion package to rescue the savings and loans industry, and also proposed the creation of the Office of Thrift Supervision to regulate the industry. Congress passed the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, which incorporated most of Bush's proposals.[87]

Bush was widely seen as a "pragmatic caretaker" president who lacked a unified and compelling long-term theme in his efforts.[88][89][90] A Bush sound bite, referring to the issue of overarching purpose as "the vision thing", has become a metonym applied to other political figures accused of similar difficulties.[91][92][93][94][95][96] His ability to gain broad international support for the Gulf War and the war's result were seen as both a diplomatic and military triumph,[97] rousing bipartisan approval,[98] tho
