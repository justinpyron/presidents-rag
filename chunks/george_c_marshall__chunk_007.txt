Marshall won recognition and acclaim for his planning of the Battle of Cantigny, which took place from 28 to 31 May 1918;[1] Marshall's success resulted in the first notable American victory of the war.[8] As he conducted pre-attack planning, Marshall traveled alone under cover of darkness to personally view the terrain and mentally map it.[9] Marshall ventured beyond the front lines and far into no-man's land, often under friendly artillery fire and routinely risking discovery and capture by Imperial German Army troops.[9] On 26 May, he was injured while traveling to several subordinate units to conduct pre-attack coordination.[10] As he departed the division headquarters area, his horse stumbled, fell, and rolled over;[10] Marshall's left foot was caught in the stirrup, and he sustained a severe sprain and bruise.[10] A physician bound Marshall's injured ankle and foot with adhesive tape so he could avoid medical evacuation and remain with the division to oversee the attack.[11] In 1920, Marshall was awarded the Citation Star for his heroism during this battle.[9] When the Silver Star medal was created in 1932, Citation Stars were converted to the new award.[9][12][13][A]
