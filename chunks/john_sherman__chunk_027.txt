At the same time as he sought to reform the coinage, Sherman worked for "resumption"—the policy of resuming specie payment on all bank notes, including the greenbacks. The idea of withdrawing the greenbacks from circulation altogether had been tried and quickly rejected in 1866; the notes were, as Sherman said, "a great favorite of the people".[62] The economic turmoil of the Panic of 1873 made it even more clear that shrinking the money supply would be harmful to the average American.[63] Still, Sherman (and others) desired an eventual return to a single circulating medium: gold.

While Sherman stood against printing additional greenbacks, as late as 1872 he remained a proponent of keeping existing greenbacks backed by bonds in circulation.[65] Over the next two years, Sherman worked to develop what became the Specie Payment Resumption Act.[66] The Act was a compromise.
