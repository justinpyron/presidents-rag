d well at Norwalk, and the next year transferred to the Webb School, a preparatory school in Middletown, Connecticut, where he studied Latin and Ancient Greek.[12] Returning to Ohio, he attended Kenyon College in Gambier in 1838.[13] He enjoyed his time at Kenyon and was successful scholastically;[14] while there, he joined several student societies and became interested in Whig politics. His classmates included Stanley Matthews and John Celivergos Zachos.[15][16] He graduated Phi Beta Kappa with the highest honors in 1842 and addressed the class as its valedictorian.[17]
After briefly reading law in Columbus, Ohio, Hayes moved east to attend Harvard Law School in 1843.[18] Graduating with an LL.B, he was admitted to the Ohio bar in 1845 and opened his own law office in Lower Sandusky (now Fremont).[19] Business was slow at first, but he gradually attracted clients and also represented his uncle Sardis in real estate litigation.[20] In 1847 Hayes became ill with what his doctor thought was tuberculosis. Thinking a change in climate would help, he considered enlisting in the Mexicanâ€“American War, but on his doctor's advice instead visited family in New England.[21] Returning from there, Hayes and his uncle Sardis made a long journey to Texas, where Hayes visited with Guy M. Bryan, a Kenyon classmate and distant relative.[22] Business remained meager on his return to Lower Sandusky, and Hayes decided to move to Cincinnati.[23]
