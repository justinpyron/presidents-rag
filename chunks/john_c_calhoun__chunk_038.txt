This, Calhoun correctly foresaw, would hurt the New Yorker's chances for the Democratic nomination. Nor did the Carolinian's ingenious strategy ultimately wreck the cause for Texas annexation. Indeed, in that respect it would turn out a brilliant success.[20]

He received these assurances and enthusiastically supported Polk's candidacy.[21] Polk narrowly defeated Henry Clay, who opposed annexation.[22] Lame-duck President Tyler organized a joint House–Senate vote on the Texas treaty which passed, requiring only a simple majority.
