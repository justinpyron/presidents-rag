ion might occur.[250] His repeated use of "Chinese virus" and "China virus" to describe COVID-19 drew criticism from health experts.[251][252][253]
By early April, as the pandemic worsened and amid criticism of his administration's response, Trump refused to admit any mistakes in his handling of the outbreak, instead blaming the media, Democratic state governors, the previous administration, China, and the WHO.[254] The daily coronavirus task force briefings ended in late April, after a briefing at which Trump suggested the dangerous idea of injecting a disinfectant to treat COVID-19;[255] the comment was widely condemned by medical professionals.[256][257]
In early May, Trump proposed the phase-out of the coronavirus task force and its replacement with another group centered on reopening the economy. Amid a backlash, Trump said the task force would "indefinitely" continue.[258] By the end of May, the coronavirus task force's meetings were sharply reduced.[259]
World Health Organization
Prior to the pandemic, Trump criticized the WHO and other international bodies, which he asserted were taking advantage of U.S. aid.[260] His administration's proposed 2021 federal budget, released in February, proposed reducing WHO funding by more than half.[260] In May and April, Trump accused the WHO of "severely mismanaging" COVID-19, alleged without evidence that the organization was under Chinese control and had enabled the Chinese government's concealment of the pandemic's origins,[260]
