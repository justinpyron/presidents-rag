As president, he solicited political as well as personal advice from her.[12] Truman learned to play the piano at age seven and took lessons from Mrs. E.C. White, a well-respected teacher in Kansas City.[13] He got up at five o'clock every morning to practice the piano, which he studied more than twice a week until he was fifteen, becoming quite a skilled player.[14] Truman worked as a page at the 1900 Democratic National Convention in Kansas City;[15] his father had many friends active in the Democratic Party who helped young Harry to gain his first political position.[16]
