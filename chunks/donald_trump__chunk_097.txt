l views of Donald Trump
Many of Trump's comments and actions have been described as racist.[37][38][39] In national polling, about half of respondents said that Trump is racist; a greater proportion believed that he emboldened racists.[40][41] Several studies and surveys found that racist attitudes fueled Trump's political ascent and were more important than economic factors in determining the allegiance of Trump voters.[42][43] Racist and Islamophobic attitudes are a powerful indicator of support for Trump.[44]
In 1975, he settled a 1973 Department of Justice lawsuit that alleged housing discrimination against black renters.[45] He has also been accused of racism for insisting a group of black and Latino teenagers were guilty of raping a white woman in the 1989 Central Park jogger case, even after they were exonerated by DNA evidence in 2002. As of 2019, he maintained this position.[46]
In 2011, when he was reportedly considering a presidential run, he became the leading proponent of the racist "birther" conspiracy theory, alleging that Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president, was not born in the U.S.[47][48] In April, he claimed credit for pressuring the White House to publish the "long-form" birth certificate, which he considered fraudulent, and later said this made him "very popular".[49][50] In September 2016, amid pressure, he acknowledged that Obama was born in the U.S.[51] In 2017, he reportedly expressed birther views privately.[52]
