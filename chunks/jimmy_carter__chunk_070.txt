Personal life

Carter's hobbies include painting,[1] fly fishing, woodworking, cycling, tennis, and skiing.[2] He also has an interest in poetry, particularly the works of Dylan Thomas.[3] During a state visit to the UK in 1977, Carter suggested that Thomas should have a memorial in Poets' Corner at Westminster Abbey;[4] this later came to fruition in 1982.[3][5]
Carter was a personal friend of Elvis Presley, whom he and Rosalynn met on June 30, 1973, before Presley was to perform onstage in Atlanta.[6] They remained in contact by telephone two months before Presley's sudden death in August 1977. Carter later recalled an abrupt phone call received in June 1977 from Presley who sought a presidential pardon from Carter, to help George Klein's criminal case; at the time Klein had been indicted for only mail fraud, and was later found guilty of conspiracy.[7][8] According to Carter, Presley was almost incoherent because of barbiturates; although he phoned the White House several times again, this was the last time they spoke.[9] The day after Presley's death, Carter issued a statement and explained how he had "changed the face of American popular culture".[10]
Carter filed a report with both the International UFO Bureau and the National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena,[11] stating that he sighted an unidentified flying object in October 1969.[12][13][14]
Beliefs
From a young age, Carter showed a deep commitment to evangelical Christianity.[15][16]
