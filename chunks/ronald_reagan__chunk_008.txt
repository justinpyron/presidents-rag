ured multiple guest stars,[47] and Ronald and Nancy Reagan, continuing to use her stage name Nancy Davis, acted together in three episodes.[48] When asked how Reagan was able to recruit such stars to appear on the show during television's infancy, he replied, "Good stories, top direction, production quality".[49] However, the viewership declined in the 1960s and the show was canceled in 1962.[50] In 1965, Reagan became the host[51] of another MCA production, Death Valley Days.[52]
Early political activities

Reagan began his political career as a Democrat, viewing Franklin D. Roosevelt as "a true hero".[1] He joined the American Veterans Committee and Hollywood Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions (HICCASP), worked with the AFLâ€“CIO to fight right-to-work laws,[2] and continued to speak out against racism when he was in Hollywood.[3] In 1945, Reagan planned to lead an HICCASP anti-nuclear rally, but Warner Bros. prevented him from going.[4] In 1946, he appeared in a radio program called Operation Terror to speak out against rising Ku Klux Klan activity in the country, citing the attacks as a "capably organized systematic campaign of fascist violence and intimidation and horror".[5] Reagan also supported Harry S. Truman in the 1948 presidential election,[6] and Helen Gahagan Douglas for the U.S. Senate in 1950. It was Reagan's belief that communism was a powerful backstage influence in Hollywood that led him to rally his friends against them.[2]
