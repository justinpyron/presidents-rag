 January 6 United States Capitol attack
For a chronological guide, see Timeline of the January 6 United States Capitol attack.
On January 6, 2021, while congressional certification of the presidential election results was taking place in the U.S. Capitol, Trump held a noon rally at the Ellipse, Washington, D.C.. He called for the election result to be overturned and urged his supporters to "take back our country" by marching to the Capitol to "fight like hell".[106][107] Many supporters did, joining a crowd already there. The mob broke into the building, disrupting certification and causing the evacuation of Congress.[108] During the violence, Trump posted messages on Twitter without asking the rioters to disperse. At 6Â p.m., Trump tweeted that the rioters should "go home with love & in peace", calling them "great patriots" and repeating that the election was stolen.[109] After the mob was removed, Congress reconvened and confirmed Biden's win in the early hours of the following morning.[110] According to the Department of Justice, more than 140 police officers were injured, and five people died.[111][112]
In March 2023, Trump collaborated with incarcerated rioters on a song to benefit the prisoners, and, in June, he said that, if elected, he would pardon many of them.[113]
