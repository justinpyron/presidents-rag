managing the pandemic, despite increasing cases and deaths.[294] A few days before the November 3 election, the U.S. reported more than 100,000 cases in a single day for the first time.[295]
Investigations
After he assumed office, Trump was the subject of increasing Justice Department and congressional scrutiny, with investigations covering his election campaign, transition, and inauguration, actions taken during his presidency, his private businesses, personal taxes, and charitable foundation.[296] There were ten federal criminal investigations, eight state and local investigations, and twelve congressional investigations.[297]
Financial
In April 2019, the House Oversight Committee issued subpoenas seeking financial details from Trump's banks, Deutsche Bank and Capital One, and his accounting firm, Mazars USA. Trump sued the banks, Mazars, and committee chair Elijah Cummings to prevent the disclosures.[298] In May, DC District Court judge Amit Mehta ruled that Mazars must comply with the subpoena,[299] and judge Edgardo Ramos of the Southern District Court of New York ruled that the banks must also comply.[300][301] Trump's attorneys appealed.[302] In September 2022, the committee and Trump agreed to a settlement about Mazars, and the accounting firm began turning over documents.[303]
