Response to the AIDS epidemic
Main article: Ronald Reagan and AIDS
The AIDS epidemic began to unfold in 1981,[118] and AIDS was initially difficult to understand for physicians and the public.[119] As the epidemic advanced, according to White House physician and later physician to the president, brigadier general John Hutton, Reagan thought of AIDS as though "it was the measles and would go away". The October 1985 death of the President's friend Rock Hudson affected Reagan's view; Reagan approached Hutton for more information on the disease. Still, between September 18, 1985, and February 4, 1986, Reagan did not mention AIDS in public.[120]
In 1986, Reagan asked C. Everett Koop to draw up a report on the AIDS issue. Koop angered many evangelical conservatives, both in and out of the Reagan administration, by stressing the importance of sex education including condom usage in schools.[121] A year later, Reagan, who reportedly had not read the report,[122] gave his first speech on the epidemic when 36,058 Americans had been diagnosed with AIDS, and 20,849 had died of it.[123] Reagan called for increased testing (including routine testing for marriage applicants) and mandatory testing of select groups (including federal prisoners).[124] Even after this speech, however, Reagan remained reluctant to publicly address AIDS.[125]
