r the extent of the conspiracy. This conclusion was based largely on audio recordings of the shooting.[14] Subsequently, investigative reports from the FBI and a specially appointed National Academy of Sciences Committee determined that "reliable acoustic data do not support a conclusion that there was a second gunman."[15] The Justice Department concluded "that no persuasive evidence can be identified to support the theory of a conspiracy".[16]

Kennedy's body was brought back to Washington. On November 23, six military pallbearers carried the flag-draped coffin into the East Room of the White House, where he lay in repose for 24 hours.[17][18] Then, the coffin was carried on a horse-drawn caisson to the Capitol to lie in state. Throughout the day and night, hundreds of thousands lined up to view the guarded casket,[19][20] with a quarter million passing through the rotunda during the 18 hours of lying in state.[19]
Kennedy's funeral service was held on November 25, at St. Matthew's Cathedral in Washington, D.C.[21] The Requiem Mass was led by Cardinal Richard Cushing, then the Archbishop of Boston.[21] It was attended by approximately 1,200 guests, including representatives from over 90 countries.[22][23] After the service, Kennedy was buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia.[24]
