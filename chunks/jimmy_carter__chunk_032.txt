ffice to 5.7% by July 1978,[45][46] but the early 1980s recession caused it to return to its pre-1977 level.[47] The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) measured a 6.6% unemployment rate average during the Carter administration.[48] His last two years were marked by double-digit inflation, very high interest rates,[49] oil shortages, and slow economic growth.[50] Due to the $30Â billion economic stimulus legislation, such as the Public Works Employment Act of 1977, proposed by Carter and passed by Congress, real household median income had grown by 5.2%, with a projection of 6.4% for the next quarter.[51]
The 1979 energy crisis ended this period of growth, and as inflation and interest rates rose, economic growth, job creation and consumer confidence declined sharply.[49] The relatively loose monetary policy adopted by Federal Reserve Board chairman G. William Miller, had already contributed to somewhat higher inflation,[52] rising from 5.8% in 1976 to 7.7% in 1978. The sudden doubling of crude oil prices by OPEC, the world's leading oil exporting cartel,[53] forced inflation to double-digit levels, averaging 11.3% in 1979 and 13.5% in 1980.[44] The sudden shortage of gasoline as the 1979 summer vacation season began exacerbated the problem and came to symbolize the crisis to the general public;[49] the acute shortage, originating in the shutdown of Amerada Hess refining facilities, led to a lawsuit against the company that year by the federal government.[54]
