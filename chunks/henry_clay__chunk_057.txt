Many monuments, memorials, and even high schools have been erected and named in honor of Clay. Sixteen counties, one each in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and West Virginia, are named for Clay. Communities named for Clay include Clay, Kentucky, Claysville, Alabama and Claysville, Pennsylvania. The United States Navy named a submarine, the USS Henry Clay, in his honor. Several statues honor Clay, including the Henry Clay Monument in Pottsville, Pennsylvania, and one of Kentucky's two statues in the National Statuary Hall Collection. Clay's estate of Ashland is a National Historic Landmark. The Decatur House, Clay's home in Washington, D.C. during his tenure as secretary of state, is also a National Historic Landmark.  Due to his involvement in the American Colonization Society, a town in the newly formed Liberia in West Africa was named Clay-Ashland after Henry Clay and to where the freed slaves from Kentucky emigrated. Clay is also one of the "famous five" senators honored with their portraits in the Senate Reception Room.[13]
