zations that were found to be Communist fronts." He served as floor manager for the Republican Party. On May 19, 1948, the bill passed the House by 319 to 58, but later it failed to pass the Senate.[11] The Nixon Library cites this bill's passage as Nixon's first significant victory in Congress.[12]
Nixon first gained national attention in August 1948, when his persistence as a House Un-American Activities Committee member helped break the Alger Hiss spy case. While many doubted Whittaker Chambers's allegations that Hiss, a former State Department official, had been a Soviet spy, Nixon believed them to be true and pressed for the committee to continue its investigation. After Hiss filed suit, alleging defamation, Chambers produced documents corroborating his allegations, including paper and microfilm copies that Chambers turned over to House investigators after hiding them overnight in a field; they became known as the "Pumpkin Papers".[13] Hiss was convicted of perjury in 1950 for denying under oath he had passed documents to Chambers.[14] In 1948, Nixon successfully cross-filed as a candidate in his district, winning both major party primaries,[15] and was comfortably reelected.[16]
