Later life and death
After his retirement from the Burns Detective Agency, Burns moved to Florida and for several years published detective and mystery stories based on his long career. He died of a heart attack in Sarasota, Florida, in April 1932.
Burns was portrayed by actor Paul Dooley in the television miniseries The Murder of Mary Phagan. A fictionalized version of Burns was played by Gary Basaraba in the film Killers of the Flower Moon; this character was an amalgamation of Burns and other private investigators that were hired to look into the Osage Indian murders.[1]
