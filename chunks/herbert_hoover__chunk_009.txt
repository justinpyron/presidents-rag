 a promotion in 1898, Hoover cabled Lou Henry, asking her to marry him. After she cabled back her acceptance of the proposal, Hoover briefly returned to the United States for their wedding.[3] They would remain married until Lou Henry Hoover's death in 1944.[4] Hoover was the first president to be a widower since Woodrow Wilson.
Though his Quaker upbringing strongly influenced his career, Hoover rarely attended Quaker meetings during his adult life.[5][6] Hoover and his wife had two children: Herbert Hoover Jr. (born in 1903) and Allan Henry Hoover (born in 1907).[3] The Hoover family began living in London in 1902, though they frequently traveled as part of Hoover's career.[7] After 1916, the Hoovers began living in the United States, maintaining homes in Stanford, California, and Washington, D.C.[8] Hoover's great-grandaughter (through Allan) is conservative political commentator, strategist, media personality and author Margaret Hoover.[9]
Hoover's elder brother Theodore also studied mining engineering at Stanford, and returned there to become dean of the engineering school. In retirement, Theodore bought a large property on the remote north coast of Santa Cruz County. The Theodore J. Hoover Natural Preserve is now part of Big Basin State Park.
