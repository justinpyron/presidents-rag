py, Hero, Heretic: Hillary".[10] Following Clinton's "choked up moment" and related incidents in the run-up to the January 2008 New Hampshire primary, both The New York Times and Newsweek found that discussion of gender's role in the campaign had moved into the national political discourse.[11][12] Newsweek editor Jon Meacham summed up the relationship between Clinton and the American public by saying the New Hampshire events, "brought an odd truth to light: though Hillary Rodham Clinton has been on the periphery or in the middle of national life for decades ... she is one of the most recognizable but least understood figures in American politics".[12]
Once she became secretary of state, Clinton's image seemed to improve dramatically among the American public and become one of a respected world figure.[13][14] Her favorability ratings dropped, however, after she left office and began to be viewed in the context of partisan politics once more.[15] By September 2015, with her 2016 presidential campaign underway and beset by continued reports regarding her private email usage at the State Department, her ratings had slumped to some of her lowest levels ever.[16] In March 2016, she acknowledged that: "I'm not a natural politician, in case you haven't noticed."[17]
