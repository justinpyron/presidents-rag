Burr's 1807 conspiracy trial became a national issue.[70] Jefferson attempted to preemptively influence the verdict by telling Congress that Burr's guilt was "beyond question", but the case came before his longtime political foe John Marshall, who dismissed the treason charge.

Instead, Jefferson provided relevant legal documents.[71] After a three-month trial, the jury found Burr not guilty, while Jefferson denounced his acquittal.[69][72][c][73] Jefferson subsequently removed Wilkinson as territorial governor but retained him in the U.S. military. Historian James N. Banner criticized Jefferson for continuing to trust Wilkinson, a "faithless plotter".[69]
