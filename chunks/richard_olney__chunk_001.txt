 to run again, preferring to return to his law practice.[2]
In 1876, Olney inherited his father-in-law's Boston law practice and became involved in the business affairs of Boston's elite families.[3]
During the 1880s, Olney became one of the Boston's leading railroad attorneys[3][4] and the general counsel for Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway.[5]
Olney was once asked by a former railroad employer if he could do something to get rid of the newly formed Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). He suggested that the ICC would become a captive regulator, replying in an 1892 letter, "The Commission... is, or can be made, of great use to the railroads. It satisfies the popular clamor for a government supervision of the railroads, at the same time that that supervision is almost entirely nominal. Further, the older such a commission gets to be, the more inclined it will be found to take the business and railroad view of things... The part of wisdom is not to destroy the Commission, but to utilize it."[6]
Attorney General
In March 1893, Olney became U.S. Attorney General and used the law to thwart strikes, which he considered an illegitimate tactic contrary to law.[1] Olney argued that the government must prevent interference with its mails and with the general railway transportation between the states.

Pullman strike
During the 1894 Pullman strike, Olney instructed district attorneys to secure from the Federal Courts writs of injunction against striking railroad employees.[2] H
