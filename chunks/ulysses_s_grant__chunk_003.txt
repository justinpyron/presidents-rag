The two soon became engaged.[18] On August 22, 1848, they were married at Julia's home in St. Louis. Grant's abolitionist father disapproved of the Dents' owning slaves, and neither of Grant's parents attended the wedding.[19] Grant was flanked by three fellow West Point graduates in their blue uniforms, including Longstreet, Julia's cousin.[c][22]
