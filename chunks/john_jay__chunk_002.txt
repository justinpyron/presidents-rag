In addition to Jay, Kissam's students included Lindley Murray.[7] Three years later, in 1767, as was the tradition at the time, Jay was promoted to Master of Arts.[8]

Entrance into law and politics
In 1768, after reading law and being admitted to the bar of New York, Jay, with the money from the government, established a legal practice and worked there until he opened his own law office in 1771.[7] He was a member of the New York Committee of Correspondence in 1774[9] and became its secretary, which was his first public role in the revolution.
Jay represented the "Radical Whig" faction that was interested in protecting property rights and in preserving the rule of law, while resisting what it regarded as British violations of colonial rights.[10] This faction feared the prospect of mob rule.
