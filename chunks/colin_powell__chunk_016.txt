e by Colin Powell as United States Secretary of State

President-elect George W. Bush named Powell as his nominee to be secretary of state in a ceremony at his ranch in Crawford, Texas on December 16, 2000.[1] This made Powell the first person to formally accept a Cabinet post in the Bush administration,[1][2] as well the first black United States secretary of state.[3] As secretary of state, Powell was perceived as moderate. Powell was unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate by voice vote on January 20, 2001,[4] and ceremonially sworn in on January 26.[5][6] Over the course of his tenure he traveled less than any other U.S. Secretary of State in thirty years.[7] This is partly attributed to a letter from former diplomat George F. Kennan, who advised Powell to focus on his duties as the president's principal foreign policy advisor and avoid trips that risked undercutting the duties of the ambassadors.[8]
On September 11, 2001, Powell was in Lima, Peru, meeting with President Alejandro Toledo and attending a meeting of foreign ministers of the Organization of American States.[9][10] After the September 11 attacks, Powell's job became of critical importance in managing the United States of America's relationships with foreign countries to secure a stable coalition in the War on Terrorism.[citation needed]
