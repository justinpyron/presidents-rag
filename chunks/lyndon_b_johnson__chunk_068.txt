As he had served less than two years of President Kennedy's term, Johnson was constitutionally eligible for election to a second full term in the 1968 presidential election.[189][190] Despite Johnson's growing unpopularity, conventional wisdom held that it would be impossible to deny re-nomination to a sitting president.[191] In September 1967 Johnson openly admitted he was considering dropping out of the race for re-election.[192] Johnson won a narrow victory in the New Hampshire presidential primary on March 12,[193] but in a March 31 speech, Johnson shocked the nation when he announced he would not run for re-election by concluding with the line: "I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president".[194] The next day, his approval ratings increased from 36 percent to 49 percent.[195]
