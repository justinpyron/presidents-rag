See also: Clayton family
Born in Dagsboro, Delaware, son of Sarah (n√©e Middleton) and James Clayton. His uncle, Dr. Joshua Clayton, was a former Governor of Delaware and his cousin, Thomas Clayton, was a prominent lawyer, U.S. Senator, and jurist. John M. Clayton studied at Berlin, Maryland and Milford, Delaware when his parents moved there. His boyhood home, known as the Parson Thorne Mansion, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.[1][2]  He graduated from Yale University in 1815, where he was a member of Brothers in Unity and then studied law at the Litchfield Law School. In 1819 he began the practice of law in Dover, Delaware.
About this time his father died and Clayton became the sole supporter of his immediate family, weekly walking the distance from Dover to Milford to see to their needs.[citation needed]
He married Sally Ann Fisher in 1822. She was the granddaughter of former Governor George Truitt.[citation needed] They had two sons, James and Charles, but she died two weeks after the birth of Charles. Clayton never remarried and raised the two boys himself.
In 1844, Clayton cultivated a tract of land near New Castle, Delaware which he called Buena Vista.[3] It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.[2
