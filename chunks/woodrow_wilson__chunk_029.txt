ecessors, Wilson increased self-governance on the islands by granting Filipinos greater control over the Philippine Legislature. The Jones Act of 1916 committed the United States to the eventual independence of the Philippines, and granted Filipinos further autonomy with the establishment of a Filipino Senate and House of Representatives, replacing the American-run Philippine Commission and Filipino-run Philippine Assembly, respectively.[36] In 1916, Wilson purchased by treaty the Danish West Indies, renamed as the United States Virgin Islands.[37]
Immigration from Europe declined significantly once World War I began and Wilson paid little attention to the issue during his presidency.[38] However, he looked favorably upon the "new immigrants" from southern and eastern Europe, and twice vetoed laws passed by Congress intended to restrict their entry, though the later veto was overridden.[39]

Wilson nominated three men to the United States Supreme Court, all of whom were confirmed by the U.S. Senate. In 1914, Wilson nominated sitting Attorney General James Clark McReynolds. Despite his credentials as an ardent trust buster,[40] McReynolds became a staple of the court's conservative bloc until his retirement in 1941.[41] According to Berg, Wilson considered appointing McReynolds one of his biggest mistakes in office.[4
