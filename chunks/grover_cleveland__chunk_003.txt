ial men there, including the partners in the law firm of Rogers, Bowen, and Rogers.[17] Millard Fillmore, the 13th president of the United States, had previously worked for the partnership.[18] Cleveland later took a clerkship with the firm, began to read the law with them, and was admitted to the New York bar in 1859.[19]
Early career and the Civil War
Cleveland worked for the Rogers firm for three years before leaving in 1862 to start his own practice.[20] In January 1863, he was appointed assistant district attorney of Erie County, New York.[21] With the American Civil War raging, Congress passed the Conscription Act of 1863, requiring able-bodied men to serve in the army if called upon, or else to hire a substitute.[19] Cleveland chose the latter course, paying $150, equivalent to $3,712 in 2023, to George Benninsky, a thirty-two-year-old Polish immigrant, to serve in his place.[22] Benninsky survived the war.[19]
As a lawyer, Cleveland became known for his single-minded concentration and dedication to hard work.[23] In 1866, he successfully defended some participants in the Fenian raid, working on a pro bono basis (free of charge).[24] In 1868, Cleveland attracted professional attention for his winning defense of a libel suit against the editor of Buffalo's Commercial Advertiser.[25] During this time, Cleveland assumed a lifestyle of simplicity, taking residence in a plain boarding house. He devoted his growing income to the support of his mother and younger sisters.[26]
