he President had initially expected his Democratic opponent to be Massachusetts senator Edward M. Kennedy (brother of the late president), who was largely removed from contention after the July 1969 Chappaquiddick incident.[92] Instead, Maine senator Edmund Muskie became the front runner, with South Dakota senator George McGovern in a close second place.[90]
On June 10, McGovern won the California primary and secured the Democratic nomination.[93] The following month, Nixon was renominated at the 1972 Republican National Convention. He dismissed the Democratic platform as cowardly and divisive.[94] McGovern intended to sharply reduce defense spending[95] and supported amnesty for draft evaders as well as abortion rights. With some of his supporters believed to be in favor of drug legalization, McGovern was perceived as standing for "amnesty, abortion and acid". McGovern was also damaged by his vacillating support for his original running mate, Missouri senator Thomas Eagleton, dumped from the ticket following revelations that he had received electroshock treatment for depression.[96][97] Nixon was ahead in most polls for the entire election cycle, and was reelected on November 7, 1972, in one of the largest landslide election victories in American history. He defeated McGovern with over 60Â percent of the popular vote, losing only in Massachusetts and D.C.[98]
