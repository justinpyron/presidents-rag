Hayes unsuccessfully attempted to fill a third vacancy in 1881. Justice Noah Haynes Swayne resigned with the expectation that Hayes would fill his seat by appointing Stanley Matthews, a friend of both men.[83] Many senators objected to the appointment, believing that Matthews was too close to corporate and railroad interests, especially those of Jay Gould,[84] and the Senate adjourned without voting on the nomination.[83] The following year, when James A. Garfield entered the White House, he resubmitted Matthews's nomination to the Senate, which this time confirmed Matthews by one vote, 24 to 23.[83] Matthews served for eight years until his death in 1889.
