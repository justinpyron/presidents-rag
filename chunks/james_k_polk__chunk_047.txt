The initial public euphoria over the victories at the start of the war slowly dissipated.[69] In August 1846, Polk asked Congress to appropriate $2 million (~$60.7 million in 2023) as a down payment for the potential purchase of Mexican lands. Polk's request ignited opposition, as he had never before made public his desire to annex parts of Mexico (aside from lands claimed by Texas). It was unclear whether such newly acquired lands would be slave or free, and there was fierce and acrimonious sectional debate. A freshman Democratic Congressman, David Wilmot of Pennsylvania, previously a firm supporter of Polk's administration, offered an amendment to the bill, the Wilmot Proviso, that would ban slavery in any land acquired using the money. The appropriation bill, with the Wilmot Proviso attached, passed the House, but died in the Senate.[70] This discord cost Polk's party, with Democrats losing control of the House in the 1846 elections.
