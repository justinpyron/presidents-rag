en worked at odd jobs in Kentucky and Tennessee before the family settled in Hardin County, Kentucky, in the early 1800s.[5]
Lincoln's mother Nancy Lincoln is widely assumed to be the daughter of Lucy Hanks.[7] Thomas and Nancy married on June 12, 1806, in Washington County, and moved to Elizabethtown, Kentucky.[8] They had three children: Sarah, Abraham, and Thomas, who died as an infant.[9]
Thomas Lincoln bought multiple farms in Kentucky, but could not get clear titles to any, losing hundreds of acres of land in property disputes.[10] In 1816, the family moved to Indiana, where the land surveys and titles were more reliable.[11] They settled in an "unbroken forest"[12] in Hurricane Township, Perry County, Indiana.[13] When the Lincolns moved to Indiana it "had just been admitted to the Union" as a "free" (non-slaveholding) state,[14] except that, though "no new enslaved people were allowed, ... currently enslaved individuals remained so".[15][c] In 1860, Lincoln noted that the family's move to Indiana was "partly on account of slavery", but mainly due to land title difficulties.[17][18]
In Kentucky and Indiana, Thomas worked as a farmer, cabinetmaker, and carpenter.[19] At various times he owned farms, livestock, and town lots, paid taxes, sat on juries, appraised estates, and served on county patrols. Thomas and Nancy were members of the Separate Baptist Church, "condemned profanity, intoxication, gossip, horse racing, and dancing." Most of its members opposed slavery.[20
