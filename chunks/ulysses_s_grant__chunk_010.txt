ther's 850-acre plantation.[7] That fall, after having malaria, Grant gave up farming.[8]
That same year, Grant acquired a slave from his father-in-law, a thirty-five-year-old man named William Jones.[9] Although Grant was not an abolitionist at the time, he disliked slavery and could not bring himself to force an enslaved man to work.[10] In March 1859, Grant freed Jones by a manumission deed, potentially worth at least $1,000 (equivalent to $34,000 in 2023).[11]
Grant moved to St. Louis, taking on a partnership with Julia's cousin Harry Boggs working in the real estate business as a bill collector, again without success and at Julia's prompting ended the partnership.[12] In August, Grant applied for a position as county engineer. He had thirty-five notable recommendations, but Grant was passed over by the Free Soil and Republican county commissioners because he was believed to share his father-in-law's Democratic sentiments.[13]
In April 1860, Grant and his family moved north to Galena, accepting a position in his father's leather goods business, "Grant & Perkins", run by his younger brothers Simpson and Orvil. In a few months, Grant paid off his debts.[14] The family attended the local Methodist church and he soon established himself as a reputable citizen.[15]
