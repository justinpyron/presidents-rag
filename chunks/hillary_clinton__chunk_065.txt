on and Hard Choices

When Clinton left the State Department, she returned to private life for the first time in thirty years.[1] She and her daughter joined her husband as named members of the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation in 2013.[2] There she focused on early childhood development efforts, including an initiative called Too Small to Fail and a $600 million initiative to encourage the enrollment of girls in secondary schools worldwide, led by former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard.[2][3]
In 2014, Clinton published a second memoir, Hard Choices, which focused on her time as secretary of state. As of July 2015[update], the book had sold about 280,000 copies.[4]
Clinton also led the No Ceilings: The Full Participation Project, a partnership with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to gather and study data on the progress of women and girls around the world since the Beijing conference in 1995.[5] The foundation began accepting new donations from foreign governments, which it had stopped doing while she was secretary of state.[a] However, even though the Clinton Foundation had stopped taking donations from foreign governments, they continued to take large donations from foreign citizens who were sometimes linked to their governments.[8]
She began work on another volume of memoirs and made appearances on the paid speaking circuit.[9] There she received $200,000–225,000 per engagement, often appearing before Wall Street firms or at business conventions.[9][10]
