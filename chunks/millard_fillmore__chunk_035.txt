Fillmore oversaw two highly-competent Secretaries of State, Daniel Webster, and after Webster's 1852 death, Edward Everett. Fillmore made all major decisions.[18] He was particularly active in Asia and the Pacific, especially with regard to Japan, which then still prohibited nearly all foreign contact.
