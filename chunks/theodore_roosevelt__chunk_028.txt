Coal strike
Main article: Coal strike of 1902
In May 1902, anthracite coal miners went on strike, threatening a national energy shortage. After threatening the coal operators with federal troops, Roosevelt won their agreement to dispute arbitration by a commission, stopping the strike. The accord with J. P. Morgan resulted in miners getting more pay for fewer hours but no union recognition.[13][14] Roosevelt said, "My action on labor should always be considered in connection with my action as regards capital, and both are reducible to my favorite formulaâ€”a square deal for every man."[15] He was the first president to help settle a labor dispute.[16]
Prosecuted misconduct
During Roosevelt's second year in office, corruption was uncovered in the Indian Service, the United States General Land Office, and the Post Office Department. He prosecuted corrupt Indian agents who had cheated Native American tribes out of land parcels. Land fraud and speculation involving Oregon timberlands, led to him and Ethan A. Hitchcock forcing General Land Office Commissioner Binger Hermann from office, in November 1902. Special prosecutor Francis J. Heney obtained 146 indictments in the Oregon Land Office bribery ring.[17] Roosevelt also prosecuted 44 postal employees on charges of bribery and fraud.[18] Historians agree he moved "quickly and decisively" to address misconduct in his administration.[19]
