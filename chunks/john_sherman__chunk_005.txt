nks. [5] The result was a House that was unable to elect a speaker for two months. When they finally agreed on the election of Nathaniel Banks of Massachusetts, the House quickly turned to the matter of Kansas.[6] Preventing the expansion of slavery to Kansas was the one issue that united Banks's fragile majority, and the House resolved to send three members to investigate the situation in that territory; Sherman was one of the three selected.[7]
Sherman spent two months in the territory and was the primary author of the 1,188-page report filed on conditions there when they returned in April 1856.[8] The report explained what anti-administration members already feared: that the principle of local control was being seriously undermined by the invasion of Missourians who, while not intending to settle there, used violence to coerce the Kansans to elect pro-slavery members to the territorial legislature.[9] The House took no action on the reports, but they were widely distributed as campaign documents.[10] That July, Sherman proposed an amendment to an army appropriation act to bar use of federal troops to enforce the acts of the Kansas territorial legislature, which many now viewed as an illegitimate body.[11] The amendment narrowly passed the House, but was removed by the Senate; the House ultimately agreed to the change.[11] In spite of this defeat, however, Sherman had achieved considerable prominence for a freshman representative.[11]
