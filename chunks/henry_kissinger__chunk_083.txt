Domestic reactions
The announcement of Kissinger's death saw a widespread mix of tribute and criticism on American social media.[22]
Joe Biden praised Kissinger's "fierce intellect" while noting that they often "disagreed strongly".[23] Former president George W. Bush stated: "America has lost one of the most dependable and distinctive voices on foreign affairs with the passing of Henry Kissinger. I have long admired the man who fled the Nazis as a young boy from a Jewish family, then fought them in the United States Army". Cindy McCain, the widow of John McCain, wrote: "Henry Kissinger was ever present in my late husband's life. While John was a prisoner of war, and in the later years, as a senator and statesman. The McCain family will miss his wit, charm, and intelligence terribly".[17]
Many negative reactions to Kissinger's death argued his decisions in government violated American values.[2][24] House of Representative members Jim McGovern, Gerry Connolly, and Greg Casar issued critical reactions to his death, with Connolly stating Kissinger's "indifference to human suffering will forever tarnish his name and shape his legacy".[25] The front page of HuffPost labeled him "The Beltway Butcher", while another HuffPost article described him as "America's Most Notorious War Criminal".[26][27] Teen Vogue mocked Kissinger with the headline: "War Criminal Responsible for Millions of Deaths Dies at 100",[28] a statement similar to that of Nick Turse of The Intercept.[
