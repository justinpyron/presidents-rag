 debt.[62] The issue developed into a personal rivalry between the two men. For example, during a celebration of Thomas Jefferson's birthday on April 13, 1830, the attendees gave after-dinner toasts. Jackson toasted: "Our federal Union: It must be preserved!" – a clear challenge to nullification. Calhoun, whose toast immediately followed, rebutted: "The Union: Next to our Liberty, the most dear!"[63]
As a compromise, Jackson supported the Tariff of 1832, which reduced the duties from the Tariff of 1828 by almost half. The bill was signed on July 9, but failed to satisfy extremists on either side.[64] On November 24, South Carolina had passed the Ordinance of Nullification,[65] declaring both tariffs null and void and threatening to secede from the United States if the federal government tried to use force to collect the duties.[66][67] In response, Jackson sent warships to Charleston harbor, and threatened to hang any man who worked to support nullification or secession.[68] On December 10, he issued a proclamation against the "nullifiers",[69] condemning nullification as contrary to the Constitution's letter and spirit, rejecting the right of secession, and declaring that South Carolina stood on "the brink of insurrection and treason".[70] On December 28, Calhoun, who had been elected to the U.S. Senate, resigned as vice president.[71]
Jackson asked Congress to pass a "Force Bill" authorizing the military to enforce the tariff. It was attacked by Calhoun as despotism.[72] Me
