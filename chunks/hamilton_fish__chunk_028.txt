Fish's 20th Century biographer, A.

There is a memorial to Fish at the Cathedral of All Saints in Albany, New York. The Hamilton Fish Newburgh-Beacon Bridge, which spans the Hudson River 50 miles north of New York City between Dutchess and Orange counties, is named after Fish.[3] A street in the Bronx, New York, is named after Fish,[4] as is Hamilton Fish Park in Manhattan.[5]
