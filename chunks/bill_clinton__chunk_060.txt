earned him the nickname "Explainer-in-Chief".[11][12]
Clinton drew strong support from the African American community and insisted that the improvement of race relations would be a major theme of his presidency.[13] In 1998, Nobel laureate Toni Morrison called Clinton "the first black president", saying, "Clinton displays almost every trope of blackness: single-parent household, born poor, working-class, saxophone-playing, McDonald's-and-junk-food-loving boy from Arkansas".[14] Morrison noted that Clinton's sex life was scrutinized more than his career accomplishments, and she compared this to the stereotyping and double standards that, she said, black people typically endure.[14] Many viewed this comparison as unfair and disparaging both to Clinton and to the African-American community.[15]
Sexual assault and misconduct allegations
Main article: Bill Clinton sexual assault and misconduct allegations
Several women have publicly accused Clinton of sexual misconduct, including rape, harassment, and sexual assault. Additionally, some commentators have characterized Clinton's sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky as predatory or non-consensual, despite the fact that Lewinsky called the relationship consensual at the time. These allegations have been revisited and lent more credence in 2018, in light of the #MeToo movement, with many commentators and Democratic leaders now saying Clinton should have been compelled to resign after the Lewinsky affair.[1
