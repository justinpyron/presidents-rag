furious at him and was unsure if she wanted to remain in the marriage.[55] The White House residence staff noticed a pronounced level of tension between the couple during this period.[56]
Public response to Clinton's handling of the matter varied. Women variously admired her strength and poise in private matters that were made public. They sympathized with her as a victim of her husband's insensitive behavior and criticized her as being an enabler to her husband's indiscretions. They also accused her of cynically staying in a failed marriage as a way of keeping or even fostering her own political influence. In the wake of the revelations, her public approval ratings shot upward to around 70Â percent, the highest they had ever been.[57]
Save America's Treasures initiative
Clinton was the founding chair of Save America's Treasures, a nationwide effort matching federal funds with private donations to preserve and restore historic items and sites.[58] This included the flag that inspired "The Star-Spangled Banner" and the First Ladies National Historic Site in Canton, Ohio.[2]
Traditional duties
Clinton was the head of the White House Millennium Council[59] and hosted Millennium Evenings,[60] a series of lectures that discussed futures studies, one of which became the first live simultaneous webcast from the White House.[2] Clinton also created the first White House Sculpture Garden, located in the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden.[61]
