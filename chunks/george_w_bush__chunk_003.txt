aine driver's license.[22] Bush said that his wife has had a stabilizing effect on his life,[18] and he attributes his decision to give up alcohol in 1986, to her influence.[23] While governor of Texas, Bush said of his wife, "I saw an elegant, beautiful woman who turned out not only to be elegant and beautiful, but very smart and willing to put up with my rough edges, and I must confess has smoothed them off over time."[18] Bush also says that his faith in God was critical in abstaining. "I believe that God helped open my eyes, which were closing because of booze".[20]
Hobbies
Bush has been an avid reader throughout his adult life, preferring biographies and histories.[24] During his presidency, Bush read the Bible daily,[25] though at the end of his second term he said on television that he is "not a literalist" about Bible interpretation.[26][27] Walt Harrington, a journalist, recalled seeing "books by John Fowles, F. Scott Fitzgerald, James Joyce, and Gore Vidal lying about, as well as biographies of Willa Cather and Queen Victoria" in his home when Bush was a Texas oilman. Other activities include cigar smoking and golf.[28] Bush has also painted many paintings. One of his best-known projects is a collection of 43 paintings of immigrants, titled Out of Many, One.[29] Another painting project was Portraits of Courage: A Commander in Chief's Tribute to America's Warrior.[30]
