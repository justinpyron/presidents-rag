Longevity
At 100 years old, Carter is the longest-lived former U.S. president.[19] He has been the earliest-serving living former president since Gerald Ford's death in 2006. In 2012, he surpassed Herbert Hoover as the longest-retired president. In 2017 and 2021, Carter became the first president to live to the 40th anniversary of his inauguration and post-presidency respectively. In 2017, Carter, then 92, became the oldest former president ever to attend an American presidential inauguration.[20][21] On March 22, 2019, he became the longest-lived US president, surpassing George H. W. Bush, who died a few months earlier at the age of 94 years, 171 days.[22] He is also the oldest of the few U.S. presidents to have been born in a hospital, all of whom are alive as of 2024.[23] He said in a 2019 interview with People that he never expected to live as long as he had and that the best explanation for longevity was a good marriage.[24] Carter entered hospice care six months before celebrating his 99th birthday at his home.[25]
