Hay's efforts to shape Lincoln's image increased his own prominence and reputation in making his association (and that of Nicolay) with the assassinated president ever more remarkable and noteworthy. According to Zeitz, "the greater Lincoln grew in death, the greater they grew for having known him so well, and so intimately, in life. Everyone wanted to know them if only to ask what it had been like—what he had been like."[6] Their answer to that, expressed in ten volumes of biography, Gale wrote, "has been incredibly influential".[4] In 1974, Lincoln scholar Roy P. Basler stated that later biographers such as Carl Sandburg did not "ma[k]e revisions of the essential story told by N.[icolay] & H.[ay].[7] Zeitz concurs, "Americans today understand Abraham Lincoln much as Nicolay and Hay hoped that they would."[8]
Hay brought about more than 50 treaties, including the Canal-related treaties,[9] and settlement of the Samoan dispute, as a result of which the United States secured what became known as American Samoa.[10] In 1900, Hay negotiated a treaty with Denmark for the cession of the Danish West Indies. That treaty failed in the Danish parliament on a tied vote.[11]
In 1923 Mount Hay, also known as Boundary Peak 167 on the Canada–United States border, was named after John Hay in recognition of his role in negotiating the US-Canada treaty resulting in the Alaska Boundary Tribunal.[12] Brown University's John Hay Library is named for him as well
