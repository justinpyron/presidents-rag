Early life
Family and youth

John Milton Hay was born in Salem, Indiana, on October 8, 1838.[1] He was the third son of Dr. Charles Hay and the former Helen Leonard. Charles Hay, born in Lexington, Kentucky, hated slavery and moved to the North in the early 1830s. A doctor, he practiced in Salem. Helen's father, David Leonard, had moved his family west from Assonet, Massachusetts, in 1818, but died en route to Vincennes, Indiana, and Helen relocated to Salem in 1830 to teach school. They married there in 1831.[2] Charles was not successful in Salem, and moved, with his wife and children, to Warsaw, Illinois, in 1841.[3]
John attended the local schools, and in 1849 his uncle Milton Hay invited John to live at his home in Pittsfield, Pike County, and attend a well-regarded local school,[4] the John D. Thomson Academy.[5] Milton was a friend of Springfield attorney Abraham Lincoln and had read law in the firm Stuart and Lincoln.[6] In Pittsfield, John first met John Nicolay, who was at the time a 20-year-old newspaperman.[7] Once John Hay completed his studies there, the 13-year-old was sent to live with his grandfather in Springfield and attend school there. His parents and uncle Milton (who financed the boy's education) sent him to Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, alm
