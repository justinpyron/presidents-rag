Jewish people to federal office, including consuls, district attorneys, and deputy postmasters. He appointed Edward S. Salomon territorial governor of Washington, the first time an American Jewish man occupied a governor's seat. In November 1869, reports surfaced of Alexander II of Russia penalizing 2,000 Jewish families for smuggling by expelling them to the interior of the country. In response, Grant publicly supported the Jewish American B'nai B'rith petition against Alexander.[14] In 1875, Grant proposed a constitutional amendment that limited religious indoctrination in public schools.[15] Schools would be for all children "irrespective of sex, color, birthplace, or religions".[16] Grant's views were incorporated into the Blaine Amendment, but it was defeated by the Senate.[17]
In October 1871, under the Morrill Act, using federal marshals, Grant prosecuted hundreds of Utah Territory Mormon polygamists.[18] Grant called polygamy a "crime against decency and morality".[19] In 1874, Grant signed into law the Poland Act, which made Mormon polygamists subject to trial in District Courts and limited Mormons on juries.[19]
Beginning in March 1873, under the Comstock Act, Grant prosecuted pornographers, in addition to abortionists. To administer the prosecutions, Grant put in charge a vigorous anti-vice activist and reformer Anthony Comstock.[20] Comstock headed a federal commission and was empowered to destroy obscene material and hand out arrest warrants to offenders.[19]
