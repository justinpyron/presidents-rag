Early life and career
Shultz was born December 13, 1920, in New York City, the only child of Margaret Lennox (n√©e Pratt) and Birl Earl Shultz. He grew up in Englewood, New Jersey.[1] His great-grandfather was an immigrant from Germany who arrived in the United States in the middle of the 19th century. Contrary to common assumption, Shultz was not a member of the Pratt family associated with John D. Rockefeller and the Standard Oil Trust.[2]
After attending the local public school, he transferred to the Englewood School for Boys (now Dwight-Englewood School), through his second year of high school.[3] In 1938, Shultz graduated from the private preparatory boarding high school Loomis Chaffee School in Windsor, Connecticut. He earned a bachelor's degree, cum laude, at Princeton University, New Jersey, in economics with a minor in public and international affairs. His senior thesis, "The Agricultural Program of the Tennessee Valley Authority", examined the Tennessee Valley Authority's effect on local agriculture, for which he conducted on-site research.[4] He graduated with honors in 1942.[1][2]
From 1942 to 1945, Shultz was on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps. He was an artillery officer, attaining the rank of captain. He was attached to the U.S. Army 81st Infantry Division duri
