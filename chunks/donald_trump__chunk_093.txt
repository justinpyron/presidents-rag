Trump says he has never drunk alcohol, smoked cigarettes, or used drugs.[11][12] He sleeps about four or five hours a night.[13][14] He has called golfing his "primary form of exercise", but usually does not walk the course.[15] He considers exercise a waste of energy because he believes the body is "like a battery, with a finite amount of energy", which is depleted by exercise.[16][17] In 2015, Trump's campaign released a letter from his longtime personal physician, Harold Bornstein, stating that Trump would "be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency".[18] In 2018, Bornstein said Trump had dictated the contents of the letter and that three of Trump's agents had seized his medical records in a February 2017 raid on the doctor's office.[18][19]
