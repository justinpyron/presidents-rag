e later attended a school operated by Elisha Ayer, a teacher originally from Connecticut.[9] He also attended a Middletown, Kentucky, academy run by Kean O'Hara, a classically trained scholar from Ireland and the father of Theodore O'Hara.[11] Ayer recalled Taylor as a patient and quick learner, but his early letters showed a weak grasp of spelling and grammar,[12][13] as well as poor handwriting. All improved over time, but his handwriting remained difficult to read.[12][13]
Marriage and family
In June 1810, Taylor married Margaret Mackall Smith, whom he had met the previous autumn in Louisville. "Peggy" Smith came from a prominent family of Maryland planters—her father was Major Walter Smith, who had served in the Revolutionary War.[1][2] The couple had six children:

Ann Mackall Taylor (1811–1875),[3] married Robert C. Wood, a U.S. Army surgeon at Fort Snelling, in 1829.[4] Their son John Taylor Wood served in the U.S. Navy and the Confederate Navy. Wood was the father of:
Zachary Taylor Wood, acting Commissioner of the North-West Mounted Police and Commissioner of Yukon Territory.
Charles Carroll Wood, Lieutenant with the British Army.
Sarah Knox "Knoxie" Taylor (1814–1835),[3] married Jefferson Davis in 1835, a subordinate officer she had met through her father at the end of the Black Hawk War; she died at 21 of malaria in St. Francisville, Louisiana, three months after her marriage.[5]
Octavia Pannell Taylor (1816–1820),[3] died in early childhood.[6]
