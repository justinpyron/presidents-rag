Legacy

Edward Everett Square, near his birthplace in Dorchester, is named for him. It is the intersection of Columbia Road, Massachusetts Avenue, East Cottage Street and Boston Street. A marker is placed near where his birthplace stood, and a statue of Everett stands near the square in Richardson Park.[1] Everett's name appears on the facade of the Boston Public Library's McKim Building,[2] which he helped found, serving for twelve years as president of its board.[3] His name was also given to his nephew, Edward Everett Hale, as well as Hale's grandson, the actor Edward Everett Horton.[4][5]
Everett, Massachusetts, separated from Malden in 1870, was named in his honor,[6] as was the borough of Everett, Pennsylvania,[7] and Mount Everett in western Massachusetts.[8] Elementary schools in Dorchester[9] and in Lincoln, Nebraska[10] are named for him, as was a school in St. Cloud, Minnesota that was torn down in 1887. Everett donated 130 books to St. Cloud, beginning the community's first library.[11] The Edward Everett House, located at 16 Harvard Street in Charlestown, was designated as a Boston Landmark by the Boston Landmarks Commission in 1996.[citation needed]
