on of California, Polk had accomplished all four of his major presidential goals.[96] With the exception of the territory acquired by the 1853 Gadsden Purchase, and some later minor adjustments, the territorial acquisitions under Polk established the modern borders of the Contiguous United States.[97]
Postwar and the territories
Polk was anxious to establish a territorial government for Oregon but the matter became embroiled in the arguments over slavery, though few thought Oregon suitable for it. Bills to establish a territorial government passed the House twice but died in the Senate. By the time Congress met again in December, California and New Mexico were in U.S. hands, and Polk in his annual message urged the establishment of territorial governments in all three.[98] The Missouri Compromise had settled the issue of the geographic reach of slavery within the Louisiana Purchase by prohibiting slavery in states north of 36°30′ latitude, and Polk sought to extend this line into the newly acquired territory.[99] This would have made slavery illegal in Oregon and San Francisco but allowed it in Los Angeles.[100] Such an extension of slavery was defeated in the House by a bipartisan alliance of Northerners.[101] In 1848 Polk signed a bill to establish the Territory of Oregon and prohibit slavery in it.[102]
In December 1848, Polk sought to establish territorial governments in California and New Mexico, a task made especially urgent by the onset of the California Gold Rush.[103
