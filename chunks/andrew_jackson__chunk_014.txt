he Spanish surrendered, and the British withdrew. Weeks later, Jackson learned that the British were planning an attack on New Orleans, which was the gateway to the Lower Mississippi River and control of the American West.[35] He evacuated Pensacola, strengthened the garrison at Mobile,[36] and led his troops to New Orleans.[37]

Main article: Battle of New Orleans
Jackson arrived in New Orleans on December 1, 1814.[38] There he instituted martial law because he worried about the loyalty of the city's Creole and Spanish inhabitants. He augmented his force by forming an alliance with Jean Lafitte's smugglers and raising units of free African Americans and Creek,[39] paying non-white volunteers the same salary as whites.[40] This gave Jackson a force of about 5,000 men when the British arrived.[41]
The British arrived in New Orleans in mid-December.[42] Admiral Alexander Cochrane was the overall commander of the operation;[43] General Edward Pakenham commanded the army of 10,000 soldiers, many of whom had served in the Napoleonic Wars.[44] As the British advanced up the east bank of the Mississippi River, Jackson constructed a fortified position to block them.[45] The climactic battle took place on January 8 when the British launched a frontal assault. Their troops made easy targets for the Americans protected by their parapets, and the attack ended in disaster.[46] The British suffered over 2,000 casualties (including Pakenham) to the Americans' 60.[47]
