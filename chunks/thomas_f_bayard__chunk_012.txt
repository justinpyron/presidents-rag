f five representatives, five senators, and five Supreme Court justices.[26]
To ensure partisan balance, there would be seven Democrats and seven Republicans; the fifteenth member was to be a Supreme Court justice chosen by the other four on the commission (themselves two Republicans and two Democrats). Justice David Davis, an independent respected by both parties, was expected to be their choice.[26] Bayard was among the seven Democrats chosen.[27] Davis upset the careful planning by accepting election to the Senate by the state of Illinois and refusing to serve on the commission.[28] The remaining Supreme Court justices were all Republicans and, with the addition of Justice Joseph P. Bradley to the place intended for Davis, the commission had an 8–7 Republican majority.[29] The commission met and considered all of the disputed ballots, awarding each to Hayes by an 8–7 party-line vote.[30] Bayard and his fellow Democrats were outraged, and the Democratic majority in the House threatened to filibuster to prevent the results from being accepted.[31] As the March 4 inauguration day approached, leaders of both parties met at Wormley's Hotel in Washington to negotiate a compromise. Republicans promised that, in exchange for Democratic acquiescence in the committee's decision, Hayes would order federal troops to withdraw from the South and accept the election of Democratic governments in the remaining "unredeemed" states there.[32] The Democrats agreed and the filibuster ended.[33]
