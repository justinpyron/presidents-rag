t would have nullified his vote.[2] The Senate floor vote took place on April 26 and Pompeo was confirmed by the full Senate by a 57â€“42 vote, with five of ten Democratic senators running for reelection in 2018 in states that Trump won in 2016, voting to confirm Pompeo.[3][4][5]
Pompeo was sworn in on April 26, 2018.[5] In testimony before the Senate, he promised to prioritize improving the low-morale issue at the State Department.[5]
Tenure as secretary of state
During his tenure as secretary of state, Pompeo was described as among the staunchest Trump loyalists in the Cabinet.[6] During his tenure, he routinely flouted norms followed by his predecessors.[6] These included a speech via satellite from Jerusalem supporting Trump's re-election, firing State Department inspector general Steve Linick, and standing on the sidelines while Trump and his allies conducted a smear campaign against career diplomat Marie Yovanovitch.[7][6][8][9] Under Pompeo's tenure, career State Department officials quit, were forced into retirement or fired, and were replaced by inexperienced political appointees.[10] Like Trump, Pompeo praised dictators and criticized the U.S.'s traditional democratic allies.[6][10] International relations scholars Daniel Drezner, Richard Sokolsky, and Aaron David Miller described Pompeo as the worst secretary of state in American history, citing numerous foreign policy failures, fealty to Trump at the cost of U.S. national interest, and improprieties in office.[11][1
