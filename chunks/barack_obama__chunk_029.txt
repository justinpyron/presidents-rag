On November 6, 2012, Obama won 332 electoral votes, exceeding the 270 required for him to be reelected as president.[28][29][30] With 51.1 percent of the popular vote,[31] Obama became the first Democratic president since Franklin D. Roosevelt to win the majority of the popular vote twice.[32][33] Obama addressed supporters and volunteers at Chicago's McCormick Place after his reelection and said: "Tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual. You elected us to focus on your jobs, not ours. And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties."[34][35]
