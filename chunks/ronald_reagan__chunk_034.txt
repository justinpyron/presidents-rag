l rights policy that could not be fulfilled during his presidency; his administration had opposed affirmative action, particularly in education, federal assistance programs, housing and employment,[71] but Reagan reluctantly continued these policies.[72] In housing, Reagan's administration saw considerably fewer fair housing cases filed than the three previous administrations.[73]
War on drugs
Main article: War on drugs
In response to concerns about the increasing crack epidemic, Reagan intensified the war on drugs in 1982.[74] While the American public did not see drugs as an important issue then, the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration and the United States Department of Defense all increased their anti-drug funding immensely.[75] Reagan's administration publicized the campaign to gain support after crack became widespread in 1985.[76] Reagan signed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 and 1988 to specify penalties for drug offenses.[77] Both bills have been criticized in the years since for promoting racial disparities.[78] Additionally, Nancy Reagan founded the "Just Say No" campaign to discourage others from engaging in recreational drug use and raise awareness about the dangers of drugs.[79] A 1988 study showed 39 percent of high school seniors using illegal drugs compared to 53 percent in 1980,[80] but Scott Lilienfeld and Hal Arkowitz say that the success of these types of campaigns have not been found to be affirmatively proven.[81]
