Early life
Ronald Wilson Reagan was born on February 6, 1911, in an apartment and commercial building in Tampico, Illinois, as the younger son of Nelle Clyde Wilson and Jack Reagan.[1] Nelle was committed to the Disciples of Christ,[2] which believed in the Social Gospel.[3] She led prayer meetings and ran mid-week prayers at her church when the pastor was out of town.[2] Reagan credited her spiritual influence[4] and he became a Christian.[5] According to American political figure Stephen Vaughn, Reagan's values came from his pastor, and the First Christian Church's religious, economic and social positions "coincided with the words, if not the beliefs of the latter-day Reagan".[6] Jack focused on making money to take care of the family,[1] but this was complicated by his alcoholism.[7] Reagan had an older brother, Neil.[8] The family lived in Chicago, Galesburg, and Monmouth before returning to Tampico. In 1920, they settled in Dixon, Illinois,[9] living in a house near the H. C. Pitney Variety Store Building.[10]
Reagan attended Dixon High School, where he developed interests in drama and football.[11] His first job involved working as a lifeguard at the Rock River in Lowell Park.[12] In 1928, Reagan began attending Eureka College[13] at Nelle's approval on religious grounds.[1
