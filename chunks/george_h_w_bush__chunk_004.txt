1956), and Doro (b. 1959).[12] Their oldest daughter, Robin, died of leukemia in 1953.[34][35]
College years
Bush enrolled at Yale College, where he took part in an accelerated program that enabled him to graduate in two and a half years rather than the usual four.[12] He was a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity and was elected its president.[36] He also captained the Yale baseball team and played in the first two College World Series as a left-handed first baseman.[37] Like his father, he was a member of the Yale cheerleading squad[38] and was initiated into the Skull and Bones secret society. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1948 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics.[39]
Business career (1948â€“1963)

After graduating from Yale, Bush moved his young family to West Texas. Biographer Jon Meacham writes that Bush's relocation to Texas allowed him to move out of the "daily shadow of his Wall Street father and Grandfather Walker, two dominant figures in the financial world," but would still allow Bush to "call on their connections if he needed to raise capital."[1] His first position in Texas was an oil field equipment salesman[2] for Dresser Industries, which was led by family friend Neil Mallon.[3] While working for Dresser, Bush lived in various places with his family: Odessa, Texas; Ventura, Bakersfield and Compton, California; and Midland, Texas.[4] In 1952, he volunteered for the successful presidential campaign of Republican candidate Dwight D. Eisenhower. Th
