After warning for several weeks that an attack was imminent, Biden responded to the invasion by imposing severe sanctions on Russia and authorizing over $8 billion in weapons shipments to Ukraine.[182][183][184] On April 29, he asked Congress for $33 billion for Ukraine,[185][186] but lawmakers later increased it to about $40 billion.[187][188][189] Biden blamed Putin for the emerging energy and food crises.[190][191][192]

In 2022, Congress approved about $113 billion in aid to Ukraine.[197] In October 2023, the Biden administration requested an additional $61.4 billion in aid for Ukraine for the year ahead,[198] but delays in the passage of further aid by the House of Representatives inhibited progress, with the additional $61 billion in aid to Ukraine added in April 2024.[199][200][201] Throughout the conflict, Biden has consistently refused Ukrainian requests to allow them to utilize weapons against Russian military targets inside Russia. An exception was granted in May 2024 for targets in the vicinity of Kharkiv for "counter-fire" purposes.[202][203][204][205]
