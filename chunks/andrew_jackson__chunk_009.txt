omas Jefferson telling him that Tennessee was ready to defend the nation's honor.[49]
Jackson also expressed uncertainty about the enterprise. He warned the Governor of Louisiana William Claiborne and Tennessee Senator Daniel Smith that some of the people involved in the adventure might be intending to break away from the United States.[50] In December, Jefferson ordered Burr to be arrested for treason.[46] Jackson, safe from arrest because of his extensive paper trail, organized the militia to capture the conspirators.[51] He testified before a grand jury in 1807, implying that it was Burr's associate James Wilkinson who was guilty of treason, not Burr. Burr was acquitted of the charges.[52]

Creek War
Main article: Creek War
On June 18, 1812, the United States declared war on the United Kingdom, launching the War of 1812.[1] Though the war was primarily caused by maritime issues,[2] it provided white American settlers on the southern frontier the opportunity to overcome Native American resistance to settlement, undermine British support of the Native American tribes,[3] and pry Florida from the Spanish Empire.[4]
Jackson immediately offered to raise volunteers for the war, but he was not called to duty until after the United States military was repeatedly defeated in the American Northwest. After these defeats, in January 1813, Jackson enlisted over 2,000 volunteers,[5] who were ordered to head to New Orleans to defend against a British attack.[6]
