Further information: President James K. Polk Historic Site

James Knox Polk was born on November 2, 1795, in a log cabin in Pineville, North Carolina.[1] He was the first of 10 children born into a family of farmers.[2] His mother Jane named him after her father, James Knox.[1] His father Samuel Polk was a farmer, slaveholder, and surveyor of Scots-Irish descent. The Polks had immigrated to America in the late 17th century, settling initially on the Eastern Shore of Maryland but later moving to south-central Pennsylvania and then to the Carolina hill country.[1]
The Knox and Polk families were Presbyterian. While Polk's mother remained a devout Presbyterian, his father, whose own father Ezekiel Polk was a deist, rejected dogmatic Presbyterianism. He refused to declare his belief in Christianity at his son's baptism, and the minister refused to baptize young James.[1][3] Nevertheless, James' mother "stamped her rigid orthodoxy on James, instilling lifelong Calvinistic traits of self-discipline, hard work, piety, individualism, and a belief in the imperfection of human nature", according to James A. Rawley's American National Biography article.[2]
In 1803, Ezekiel Polk led four of his adult children and their families to the Duck River area in what is now Maury County, T
