 was initially unsuccessful. On January 15, 1981, as Muskie was flying to address the Maine Senate in Augusta, President Carter called him as his jet was touching down at Andrews Air Force Base.[15] Carter alerted him that there was a possible breakthrough in the negotiations conducted by his deputy secretary Warren Christopher.[15] After the negotiations failed, Muskie instructed the state department to continue seeking an agreement for the hostages' release.[10] On January 20—the inauguration day of Ronald Reagan—the fifty-two hostages were handed over to U.S. authorities, a solution that had eluded Muskie and the entire Carter administration for 444 days and contributed to Carter's defeat.[14]
Muskie left office on January 18, 1981, two days before Carter's last day as president and the inauguration of Ronald Reagan.[8]
Later years

Muskie retired to his home in Bethesda, Maryland, in 1981. He continued to work as a lawyer for some years. After leaving public office, he was a partner with Chadbourne & Parke, a law firm in Washington.[1] Muskie also served as the chairman of the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy at Georgetown University as well as the chairman emeritus of the Center for National Policy.[2]
In 1981, he was awarded the Laetare Medal by the University of Notre Dame, considered the most prestigious award for American Catholics.[3]
