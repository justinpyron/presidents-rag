"Reaganomics" and the economy
Main article: Reaganomics
Reagan advocated a laissez-faire philosophy,[6] and promoted a set of neoliberal reforms dubbed "Reaganomics", which included monetarism and supply-side economics.[7]
Taxation
Reagan worked with the boll weevil Democrats to pass tax and budget legislation in a Congress led by Tip O'Neill, a liberal who strongly criticized Reaganomics.[8][a] He lifted federal oil and gasoline price controls on January 28, 1981,[10] and in August, he signed the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981[11] to dramatically lower federal income tax rates and require exemptions and brackets to be indexed for inflation starting in 1985.[12] Amid growing concerns about the mounting federal debt, Reagan signed the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982,[13] one of the eleven times Reagan raised taxes.[14] The bill doubled the federal cigarette tax, rescinded a portion of the corporate tax cuts from the 1981 tax bill,[15] and according to Paul Krugman, "a third of the 1981 cut" overall.[16] Many of his supporters condemned the bill, but Reagan defended his preservation of cuts on individual income tax rates.[17] By 1983, the amount of federal tax had fallen for all or most taxpayers, but most strongly affected the wealthy.[18]
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced the number of tax brackets and top tax rate, and almost doubled personal exemptions.[19]
