Reagan appointed Alan Greenspan to succeed Volcker in 1987. Greenspan raised interest rates in another attempt to curb inflation, setting off the Black Monday stock market crash, although the markets eventually recovered.[31] By 1989, the BLS measured the unemployment rate at 5.3 percent.[32] The inflation rate dropped from 12 percent during the 1980 election to under 5 percent in 1989. Likewise, the interest rate dropped from 15 percent to under 10 percent.[33] Yet, not all shared equally in the economic recovery, and both economic inequality[34] and the number of homeless individuals increased during the 1980s.[35] Critics have contended that a majority of the jobs created during this decade paid the minimum wage.[36]
