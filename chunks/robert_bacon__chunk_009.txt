Bacon directed American participation in the London Naval Conference through February 1909, where American delegates proposed to invest a new International Prize Court with permanent jurisdiction as a court of international justice.

Upon his arrival, Bacon focused on securing relief aid for the Great Flood of Paris. In April 1910, he hosted Theodore Roosevelt on the latter's return from an African safari. During the visit, Roosevelt delivered his famous Citizenship in a Republic speech at the Sorbonne.[6]
