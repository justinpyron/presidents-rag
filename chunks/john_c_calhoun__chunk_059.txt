 Calhoun's name from Clemson University Calhoun Honors College, renaming it to Clemson University Honors College. This action was taken in response to a petition which was supported by NFL stars DeAndre Hopkins and Deshaun Watson who are Clemson University alumni.[2] Against the backdrop of the George Floyd protests,[3] University chairman Smyth McKissick said that "we must recognize there are central figures in Clemson's history whose ideals, beliefs and actions do not represent the university's core values of respect and diversity".[2]
The Confederate government honored Calhoun on a 1Â¢ postage stamp, which was printed in 1862 but was never officially released.[4]
In 1887, at the height of the Jim Crow era, white segregationists erected a monument to Calhoun in Marion Square in Charleston, South Carolina; the base was within easy reach and the local black population defaced it. Finally, it was replaced in 1896 standing atop a column base at a total of 115 feet[5] as well as fenced in to deter attackers. It continued as a target of vandalism regardless.[6][7] The statue has been a topic of debate for a long time. In 2017, Charleston's city council deferred a proposal to put a plaque on the statue that would have stated his white-supremacist views.[8] It was No. 5 on the Make It Right Project's 2018 list of the 10 Confederate monuments it most wanted removed.[9] The Make It Right Project organized a protest at the monument on May 16, 2019.[10] The monument was removed on June
