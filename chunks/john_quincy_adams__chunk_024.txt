is own victory in the contingent election would require the support of Clay, who wielded immense influence in the House of Representatives.[10] Though they were quite different in temperament and had clashed in the past, Adams and Clay shared similar views on national issues. By contrast, Clay viewed Jackson as a dangerous demagogue, and he was unwilling to support Crawford due to the latter's health issues.[11] Adams and Clay met before the contingent election, and Clay agreed to support Adams in the election.[12] Adams also met with Federalists such as Daniel Webster, promising that he would not deny governmental positions to members of their party.[13] On February 9, 1825, Adams won the contingent election on the first ballot, taking 13 of the 24 state delegations. Adams won the House delegations of all the states in which he or Clay had won a majority of the electoral votes, as well as the delegations of Illinois, Louisiana, and Maryland.[12] Adams's victory made him the first child of a president to serve as president himself.[a] After the election, many of Jackson's supporters claimed that Adams and Clay had reached a "Corrupt bargain" whereby Adams promised Clay the position of Secretary of State in return for Clay's support.[12]
