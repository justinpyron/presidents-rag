wing her husband's November 1978 election as governor of Arkansas, Rodham became that state's first lady in January 1979. She would hold that title for twelve nonconsecutive years (1979–1981, 1983–1992). Clinton appointed his wife to be the chair of the Rural Health Advisory Committee the same year,[29] in which role she secured federal funds to expand medical facilities in Arkansas's poorest areas without affecting doctors' fees.[30]
In 1979, Rodham became the first woman to be made a full partner in Rose Law Firm.[31] From 1978 until they entered the White House, she had a higher salary than her husband.[32] During 1978 and 1979, while looking to supplement their income, Rodham engaged in the trading of cattle futures contracts;[33] an initial $1,000 investment generated nearly $100,000 when she stopped trading after ten months.[34] At this time, the couple began their ill-fated investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation real estate venture with Jim and Susan McDougal.[33] Both of these became subjects of controversy in the 1990s.[35]
On February 27, 1980, Rodham gave birth to the couple's only child, a daughter whom they named Chelsea. In November 1980, Bill Clinton was defeated in his bid for re-election.[36]
