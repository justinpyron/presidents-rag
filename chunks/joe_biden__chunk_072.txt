Biden initially insisted that he would remain a candidate,[316] but on July 21, he withdrew his candidacy, writing that this was "in the best interest of my party and the country".[317][318] He endorsed Harris as his successor.[319][320] His announcement came 29 days before the beginning of the 2024 Democratic National Convention.[321][322] On August 6, 2024, Harris was confirmed as the Democratic presidential nominee after securing 99% of the delegates in a virtual roll call vote.[323] This was the first time an eligible incumbent had declined to run for reelection since Lyndon B.
