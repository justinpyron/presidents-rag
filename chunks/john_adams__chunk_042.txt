The "Hamiltonians who surround him," Jefferson remarked, "are only a little less hostile to him than to me."[3] Although aware of Hamilton's influence, Adams was convinced that their retention ensured a smoother succession.[4] Adams maintained the economic programs of Hamilton, who regularly consulted with key cabinet members, especially the powerful Treasury Secretary, Oliver Wolcott Jr.[5] Adams was in other respects quite independent of his cabinet, often making decisions despite opposition from it.[6] Hamilton had grown accustomed to being regularly consulted by Washington. Shortly after Adams was inaugurated, Hamilton sent him a detailed letter with policy suggestions. Adams dismissively ignored it.[7]
