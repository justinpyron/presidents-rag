 court for serious crimes to 14.[10] Bush presided over 152 executions,[11] more than any previous governor in modern American history; critics such as Helen Prejean argue that he failed to give serious consideration to clemency requests.[12][13] Critics also contended that during his tenure, Texas ranked near the bottom in environmental evaluations. Supporters pointed to his efforts to raise the salaries of teachers and improve educational test scores.[1]
In 1999, Bush signed a law that required electric retailers to buy a certain amount of energy from renewable sources (RPS),[14][15][16] which helped Texas eventually become the leading producer of wind powered electricity in the U.S.[17][18]
In 1998, Bush won re-election with a record[1] 68 percent of the vote.[19] He became the first governor in Texas history to be elected to two consecutive four-year terms.[1] During his second term, Bush promoted faith-based organizations and enjoyed high approval ratings, which ranged between 62 and 81 percent.[1][20] He proclaimed June 10, 2000, to be Jesus Day in Texas, a day on which he urged all Texans to "answer the call to serve those in need".[21]
Throughout Bush's first term, he was the focus of national attention as a potential future presidential candidate. Following his re-election, speculation soared, and within a year he decided to seek the 2000 Republican presidential nomination.[1]
