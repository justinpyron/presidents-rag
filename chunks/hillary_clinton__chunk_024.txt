 records; however, no formal investigation was made and she was never charged with any wrongdoing in relation to this.[35]
An outgrowth of the "Travelgate" investigation was the June 1996 discovery of improper White House access to hundreds of FBI background reports on former Republican White House employees, an affair that some called "Filegate".[36] Accusations were made that Clinton had requested these files and she had recommended hiring an unqualified individual to head the White House Security Office.[37] The 2000 final Independent Counsel report found no substantial or credible evidence that Clinton had any role or showed any misconduct in the matter.[36]
In early 2001, a controversy arose over gifts that were sent to the White House; there was a question whether the furnishings were White House property or the Clintons' personal property. During the last year of Bill Clinton's time in office, those gifts were shipped to the Clintons' private residence.[38][39]
It Takes a Village and other writings
In 1996, Clinton presented a vision for American children in the book It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us. In January 1996, she went on a ten-city book tour and made numerous television appearances to promote the book,[40] although she was frequently hit with questions about her involvement in the Whitewater and Travelgate controversies.[41][42]
The book spent 18Â weeks on the New York Times Best Seller List that year, including three weeks at number one.[
