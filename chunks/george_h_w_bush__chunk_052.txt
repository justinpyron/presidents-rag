The pardons effectively brought an end to the Iran-Contra scandal.[126]

A rare event was the presence of a strong third-party candidate. Liberals launched a backlash against 12 years of a conservative White House. The chief factor was Clinton uniting his party and winning over several heterogeneous groups.[127]
