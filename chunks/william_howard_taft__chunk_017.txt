ry to aid his heir apparent.[1] On pain of the loss of their jobs, political appointees were required to support Taft or remain silent.[2]
A number of Republican politicians, such as Treasury Secretary George Cortelyou, tested the waters for a run but chose to stay out. New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes ran, but when he made a major policy speech, Roosevelt the same day sent a special message to Congress warning in strong terms against corporate corruption. The resulting coverage of the presidential message relegated Hughes to the back pages.[3] Roosevelt reluctantly deterred repeated attempts to draft him for another term.[4]
Assistant Postmaster General Frank H. Hitchcock resigned from his office in February 1908 to lead the Taft effort.[5] In April, Taft made a speaking tour, traveling as far west as Omaha before being recalled to straighten out a contested election in Panama. He had no serious opposition at the 1908 Republican National Convention in Chicago in June, and gained a first-ballot victory. Yet Taft did not have things his own way: he had hoped his running mate would be a midwestern progressive like Iowa Senator Jonathan Dolliver, but instead the convention named Congressman James S. Sherman of New York, a conservative. Taft resigned as Secretary of War on June 30 to devote himself full-time to the campaign.[6][7]
