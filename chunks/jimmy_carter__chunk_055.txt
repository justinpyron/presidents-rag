On October 28, Carter and Reagan participated in the sole presidential debate of the election cycle in which they were both present, due to Carter refusing to participate in debates that included Anderson.[170] Though initially trailing Carter by several points,[171] Reagan experienced a surge in polling after the debate.[172] This was in part influenced by Reagan deploying the phrase "There you go again", which became the election's defining phrase.[173] It was later discovered that in the final days of the campaign, Reagan's team acquired classified documents Carter used to prepare for the debate.[174]
