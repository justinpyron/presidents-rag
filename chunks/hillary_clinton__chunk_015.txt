ran and was reelected for the final time.[50]
From 1982 to 1988, Clinton was on the board of directors, sometimes as chair, of the New World Foundation,[51] which funded a variety of New Left interest groups.[52] Clinton was chairman of the board of the Children's Defense Fund[53][54] and on the board of the Arkansas Children's Hospital's Legal Services (1988–92).[55] In addition to her positions with nonprofit organizations, she also held positions on the corporate board of directors of TCBY (1985–92),[56] Wal-Mart Stores (1986–92)[57] and Lafarge (1990–92).[58] TCBY and Wal-Mart were Arkansas-based companies that were also clients of Rose Law.[47][59] Clinton was the first female member on Wal-Mart's board, added following pressure on chairman Sam Walton to name a woman to it.[59] Once there, she pushed successfully for Wal-Mart to adopt more environmentally friendly practices. She was largely unsuccessful in her campaign for more women to be added to the company's management and was silent about the company's famously anti-labor union practices.[57][59][60] According to Dan Kaufman, awareness of this later became a factor in her loss of credibility with organized labor, helping contribute to her loss in the 2016 election, where slightly less than half of union members voted for Donald Trump.[61][62]
