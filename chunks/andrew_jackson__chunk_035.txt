having to compete with lower-priced imports from Britain.[55] The tariff reduced the income of southern cotton planters: it propped up consumer prices, but not the price of cotton which had severely declined in the previous decade.[56] Immediately after the tariff's passage, the South Carolina Exposition and Protest was sent to the U.S. Senate.[57] This document, which had been anonymously written by John C. Calhoun, asserted that the constitution was a compact of individual states[58] and when the federal government went beyond its delegated duties, such as enacting a protective tariff, a state had a right to declare this action unconstitutional and make the act null and void within the borders of that state.[59]
Jackson suspected Calhoun of writing the Exposition and Protest and opposed his interpretation. Jackson argued that Congress had full authority to enact tariffs and that a dissenting state was denying the will of the majority.[60] He also needed the tariff, which generated 90% of the federal revenue,[61] to achieve another of his presidential goals, eliminating the national debt.[62] The issue developed into a personal rivalry between the two men. For example, during a celebration of Thomas Jefferson's birthday on April 13, 1830, the attendees gave after-dinner toasts. Jackson toasted: "Our federal Union: It must be preserved!" – a clear challenge to nullification. Calhoun, whose toast immediately followed, rebutted: "The Union: Next to our Liberty, the most dear!"[
