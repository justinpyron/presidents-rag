Joseph worked at the Chicago Sun-Times as a journalist, and Albright worked as a picture editor for Encyclop√¶dia Britannica.[27] The following year, Joseph Albright began work at Newsday in New York City, and the couple moved to Garden City on Long Island.[28] That year, she gave birth to twin daughters, Alice Patterson Albright and Anne Korbel Albright. The twins were born six weeks premature and required a long hospital stay. As a distraction, Albright began Russian language classes at Hofstra University in the Village of Hempstead nearby.[28]
In 1962, the family moved to Washington, D.C., where they lived in Georgetown. Albright studied international relations and continued in Russian at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies, a division of Johns Hopkins University in the capital.[29]

She continued her studies at Columbia University's Department of Public Law and Government.[31] (It was later renamed as the political science department, and is located within the School of International and Public Affairs.) She earned a certificate in Russian from the Russian Institute (now Harriman Institute),[32][33] an M.A. and a PhD, writing her master's thesis on the Soviet diplomatic corps and
