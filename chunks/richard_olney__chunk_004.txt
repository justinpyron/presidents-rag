subject, now known as the Olney interpretation.[2]
Later years

Olney returned to the practice of the law in 1897,[1] at the expiration of Cleveland's term.
In March 1913, Olney turned down President Wilson's offer to be the US Ambassador to Great Britain,[2] and later, in May 1914, when President Wilson offered Olney the Appointment as Governor of the Federal Reserve Board, he declined that appointment.  Olney was unwilling to take on new responsibilities at his advanced age.[3]
Personal life
In 1861, Olney married Agnes Park Thomas of Boston, Massachusetts.[1]
Olney was the uncle of Massachusetts Congressman Richard Olney II.[citation needed]
Author H.W. Brands recounts claims that Olney "responded to a daughter's indiscretion by banishing her from his home, never to see her again, although they lived in the same city for thirty years."[2]

Honors
Olney received the honorary degree of LL.D from Harvard and Brown in 1893 and from Yale University in 1901.[1] He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1897.[3]
Wikisource has the text of the 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica article "Olney, Richard".
