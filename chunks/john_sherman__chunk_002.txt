Around the same time, Sherman began to take a larger role in politics. In 1844, he addressed a political rally on behalf of the Whig candidate for president that year, Henry Clay.[14] Four years later, Sherman was a delegate to the Whig National Convention where the eventual winner Zachary Taylor was nominated.[14] As with most conservative Whigs, Sherman supported the Compromise of 1850 as the best solution to the growing sectional divide.[15] In 1852, Sherman was again a delegate to the Whig National Convention, where he supported the eventual nominee, Winfield Scott, against rivals Daniel Webster and incumbent Millard Fillmore, who had become president following Taylor's death.[14]
