 unlikely to win the presidency, he supported General Zachary Taylor for the Whig nomination in the 1848 presidential election.[13] Taylor won and Lincoln hoped in vain to be appointed Commissioner of the United States General Land Office.[14] The administration offered to appoint him secretary or governor of the Oregon Territory as consolation.[15] This distant territory was a Democratic stronghold, and acceptance of the post would have disrupted his legal and political career in Illinois, so he declined and resumed his law practice.[16]

In his Springfield practice, Lincoln handled "every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer".[1] Twice a year he appeared for 10 consecutive weeks in county seats in the Midstate county courts; this continued for 16 years.[2] Lincoln handled transportation cases in the midst of the nation's western expansion, particularly river barge conflicts under the many new railroad bridges. As a riverboat man, Lincoln initially favored those interests, but ultimately represented whoever hired him.[3] He later represented a bridge company against a riverboat company in Hurd v. Rock Island Bridge Company, a landmark case involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge.[4] In 1849 he received a patent for a flotation device for the movement of boats in shallow water. The idea was never commercialized, but it made Lincoln the only president to hold a patent.[5]
