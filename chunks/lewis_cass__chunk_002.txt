ar them. The British detected the Americans, and sent a party of Indians over a nearby bridge to draw them out; however, once the Indians crossed, the concealed Americans opened fire, wounding two and killing one. Cass and Miller send word to General William Hull, requesting permission to attack Fort Malden and hold it until reinforcements arrived. However, Hull, an indecisive officer, was unsupportive and refused to agree to their request, which led Cass and Miller to withdraw their men back to American lines.[1]
Second engagement at bridge near Fort Malden
On July 19, 1812, Colonel Duncan McArthur with a reconnaissance force combined with 150 Ohio infantry troops under Cass were near the bridge leading to Fort Malden. Two British guns fired on the Americans and disabled an American cannon. The Americans captured two British soldiers after they crossed the bridge, before safely withdrawing with their prisoners.[2]
