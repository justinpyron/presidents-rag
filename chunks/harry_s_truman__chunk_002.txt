 Independence High School in 1901,[17] Truman took classes at Spalding's Commercial College, a Kansas City business school. He studied bookkeeping, shorthand, and typing but stopped after a year.[18]
Segregation was practiced and largely accepted where Truman grew up. While he would later come to support civil rights, early letters of the young Truman reflected his upbringing and prejudices against African and Asian Americans.[19]
Working career

Truman was employed briefly in the mailroom of The Kansas City Star[1] before making use of his business college experience to obtain a job as a timekeeper for construction crews on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, which required him to sleep in workmen's camps along the rail lines.[2] Truman and his brother Vivian later worked as clerks at the National Bank of Commerce in Kansas City.[3]
In 1906, Truman returned to the Grandview farm, where he lived until entering the army in 1917.[4] During this period, he courted Bess Wallace.[5] He proposed in 1911, but she turned him down.[6] Believing Wallace turned him down because he did not have much money, Truman later said he intended to propose again, but he wanted to have a better income than that earned by a farmer.[7] In fact, Wallace later told Truman she did not intend to marry, but if she did, it would be to him.[6] Still determined to improve his finances, during his years on the farm and immediately after World War I, Truman became active in several business ventures.
