Under Secretary for Political Affairs
On February 2, 2016, the Senate confirmed Shannon as Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs.[12]
In June 2016, Shannon complained about the Government of China's claim of domination in the South China Sea, calling it "madness." On June 29, 2016, he met with India Foreign Secretary Jaishankar, and expressed support for the Indian government, calling it America's "anchor" in the Asia-Pacific region.[13]
On February 1, 2018, Shannon announced his plans for retirement, saying he would stay in the job until a replacement is named. He told the Associated Press the retirement was for personal rather than political reasons, noting his age and the recent death of his mother.[14]
In 2020, Shannon, along with over 130 other former Republican national security officials, signed a statement that asserted that President Trump was unfit to serve another term, and "To that end, we are firmly convinced that it is in the best interest of our nation that Vice President Joe Biden be elected as the next President of the United States, and we will vote for him."[15]
