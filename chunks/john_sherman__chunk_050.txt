 bill Sherman proposed was simple, stating that "[e]very contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal".[a] The bill further prescribed criminal penalties for any person who monopolizes trade.[b] In debate, Sherman praised the effects of corporations on developing industry and railroads and asserted the right for people to form corporations, so long as they were "not in any sense a monopoly".[40]
The bill passed the Senate by an overwhelming 52â€“1 vote and passed the House without dissent. President Harrison signed the bill into law on July 2, 1890.[37] When Harrison signed the Act, he remarked, "John Sherman has fixed General Alger."[41] Sherman was the prime mover in getting the bill passed and became "by far the most articulate spokesman for antitrust in Congress".[42] The Act was later criticized for its simple language and lack of defined terms, but Sherman defended it, saying that it drew on common-law language and precedents.[43] He also denied that the Act was anti-business at all, saying that it only opposed unfair business practices.[43] Sherman emphasized that the Act aimed not at lawful competition, but at illegal combination.[44] The later analysis was more generous: "The Sherman Act was as good an antitrust law as the Congress of 1890 could have devised."[45]
