 but signed a bill to create the holiday in 1983 after it passed both houses of Congress with veto-proof margins.[65] In 1984, he signed legislation intended to impose fines for fair housing discrimination offenses.[66] In March 1988, Reagan vetoed the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, but Congress overrode his veto. He had argued that the bill unreasonably increased the federal government's power and undermined the rights of churches and business owners.[67] Later in September, legislation was passed to correct loopholes in the Fair Housing Act of 1968.[68][69]
Early in his presidency, Reagan appointed Clarence M. Pendleton Jr., known for his opposition to affirmative action and equal pay for men and women, as chair of the United States Commission on Civil Rights despite Pendleton's hostility toward long-established civil rights views. Pendleton and Reagan's subsequent appointees greatly eroded the enforcement of civil rights law, arousing the ire of civil rights advocates.[70] In 1987, Reagan unsuccessfully nominated Robert Bork to the Supreme Court as a way to achieve his civil rights policy that could not be fulfilled during his presidency; his administration had opposed affirmative action, particularly in education, federal assistance programs, housing and employment,[71] but Reagan reluctantly continued these policies.[72] In housing, Reagan's administration saw considerably fewer fair housing cases filed than the three previous administrations.[73]
