m.[16] His time as speaker came to an end following the 1874-75 elections which produced a Democratic majority in the House for the 44th Congress.[17]
Blaine was an effective Speaker with a magnetic personality. In the words of Washington journalist Benjamin Perley Poore, Blaine's "graceful as well as powerful figure, his strong features, glowing with health, and his hearty, honest manner, made him an attractive speaker and an esteemed friend."[18] Moreover, President Ulysses S. Grant valued his skill and loyalty in leading the House.[19] He enjoyed the job and made his presence in Washington more permanent by buying a large residence on Fifteenth Street in the city.[20] At the same time, the Blaine family moved to a mansion in Augusta.[20][a]
During Blaine's six-year tenure as Speaker his popularity continued to grow, and Republicans dissatisfied with Grant mentioned Blaine as a potential presidential candidate prior to the 1872 Republican National Convention.[21] Instead, Blaine worked steadfastly for Grant's re-election.[21] Blaine's growing fame brought growing opposition from the Democrats, as well, and during the 1872 campaign he was accused of receiving bribes in the Cr√©dit Mobilier scandal.[22] Blaine denied any part in the scandal, which involved railroad companies bribing federal officials to turn a blind eye to fraudulent railroad contracts that overcharged the government by millions of dollars.[22] No one was able to satisfactorily prove Blaine's involvement.
