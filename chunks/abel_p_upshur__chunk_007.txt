Main article: USS Princeton disaster of 1844
On February 28, 1844, Upshur joined President Tyler and about 400 other dignitaries examining the new steamship USS Princeton, which sailed down the Potomac River from Alexandria, Virginia. He and Gilmer, his successor as Secretary of the Navy, and four other passengers died when one of the ship's guns exploded near Fort Washington, Maryland, during a demonstration of its firing power, and many other officers and passengers were wounded.[1] Upshur was buried at the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, DC. In 1874, later his remains were reinterred at Oak Hill Cemetery.[2]
Legacy
The destroyer USS Abel P. Upshur was commissioned in 1920, and was later a Lend-Lease ship for Great Britain.
In World War II, the United States liberty ship SS Abel Parker Upshur was named in his honor.
These places have been named for him:

Upshur County, West Virginia
