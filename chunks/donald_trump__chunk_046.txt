In 2017, when North Korea's nuclear weapons were increasingly seen as a serious threat,[158] Trump escalated his rhetoric, warning that North Korean aggression would be met with "fire and fury like the world has never seen".[159][160] In 2017, Trump declared that he wanted North Korea's "complete denuclearization", and engaged in name-calling with leader Kim Jong Un.[159][161] After this period of tension, Trump and Kim exchanged at least 27 letters in which the two men described a warm personal friendship.[162][163] In March 2019, Trump lifted some U.S. sanctions against North Korea against the advice of his Treasury Department.[164]
Trump, the first sitting U.S. president to meet a North Korean leader, met Kim three times: in Singapore in 2018, in Hanoi in 2019, and in the Korean Demilitarized Zone in 2019.[165] However, no denuclearization agreement was reached,[166] and talks in October 2019 broke down after one day.[167] While conducting no nuclear tests since 2017, North Korea continued to build up its arsenal of nuclear bombs and ballistic missiles.[168][169]
