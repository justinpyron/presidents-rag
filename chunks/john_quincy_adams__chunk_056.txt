He remains the only U.S. president who could converse in Russian.[16]
Legacy
Historical reputation
Adams is widely regarded as one of the most effective diplomats and secretaries of state in American history,[1][2] but scholars generally rank him as an average president.[3][4] Adams is remembered as a man eminently qualified for the presidency, yet hopelessly weakened in his presidential leadership potential because of the 1824 election. Most importantly, Adams is remembered as a poor politician in an era when politics had begun to matter more. He spoke of trying to serve as a man above the "baneful weed of party strife" at the precise moment in history when the Second Party System was emerging with nearly revolutionary force.[5] Biographer and historian William J. Cooper Jr. comments that Adams "does not loom large in the American imagination", but that he has received more public attention
