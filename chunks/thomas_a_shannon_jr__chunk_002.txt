State Department Counselor
In December 2013, Shannon was appointed as Counselor of the United States Department of State, only the second Foreign Service Officer ever appointed to that office. In early 2015, President Obama issued an executive order levying sanctions against seven Venezuelan officials; the order also called Venezuela a threat to the United States. President Nicol√°s Maduro accused the United States government of planning to invade Venezuela.
In April 2015, The New York Times reported that Shannon was in Venezuela, and was supposedly going to meet with President Maduro. Shannon was supposedly there to deliver a message to Maduro from the United States government. The State Department later issued a statement saying that the Venezuelan government had invited the United States government to send a diplomat to Caracas to meet with Maduro before the Summit of the Americas meeting. The Venezuelan Foreign Ministry then issued a statement saying that Shannon had met with the Venezuelan Foreign Minister. The Foreign Ministry later confirmed that Shannon "brought a message from his government."[3]
Shannon retained his position as Counselor until February 12, 2016, when he was appointed as Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs for the last year of Barack Obama's presidency.[1][4][5][6]
