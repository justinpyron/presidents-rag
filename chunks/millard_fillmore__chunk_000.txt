Early life and career

Millard Fillmore was born on January 7, 1800, in a log cabin, on a farm in what is now Moravia, in the Finger Lakes region of New York. His parents were Phoebe Millard and Nathaniel Fillmore;[1] he was the second of eight children and the oldest son.[2] The Fillmores were of English descent; John Fillmore arrived in Ipswich, Massachusetts, during the colonial era.[3][4]
Nathaniel Fillmore was the son of Nathaniel Fillmore Sr., a native of Franklin, Connecticut, who became one of the earliest settlers of Bennington, Vermont.[5] Nathaniel Fillmore and Phoebe Millard moved from Vermont in 1799 and sought better opportunities than were available on Nathaniel's stony farm, but the title to their Cayuga County land proved defective, and the Fillmore family moved to nearby Sempronius, where they leased land as tenant farmers, and Nathaniel occasionally taught school.[6][7] The historian Tyler Anbinder described Fillmore's childhood as "one of hard work, frequent privation, and virtually no formal schooling."[1]
Over time Nathaniel became more successful in Sempronius, but during Millard's formative years, the family endured severe poverty.[a] Nathaniel became sufficiently regarded that he was chosen to serve in local offices, including justice of the peace.[10] Ho
