of Donald Trump as president
At the end of his term, Trump went to live at his Mar-a-Lago club and established an office as provided for by the Former Presidents Act.[1][2][3] Trump is entitled to live there legally as a club employee.[4][5]
Trump's false claims concerning the 2020 election were commonly referred to as the "big lie" in the press and by his critics. In May 2021, Trump and his supporters attempted to co-opt the term, using it to refer to the election itself.[6][7] The Republican Party used Trump's false election narrative to justify the imposition of new voting restrictions in its favor.[7][8] As late as July 2022, Trump was still pressuring state legislators to overturn the 2020 election.[9]
Unlike other former presidents, Trump continued to dominate his party; he has been described as a modern party boss. He continued fundraising, raising more than twice as much as the Republican Party itself, and profited from fundraisers many Republican candidates held at Mar-a-Lago. Much of his focus was on how elections are run and on ousting election officials who had resisted his attempts to overturn the 2020 election results. In the 2022 midterm elections he endorsed over 200 candidates for various offices, most of whom supported his false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him.[10][11][12]
Business activities
