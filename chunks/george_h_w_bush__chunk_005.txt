t position in Texas was an oil field equipment salesman[2] for Dresser Industries, which was led by family friend Neil Mallon.[3] While working for Dresser, Bush lived in various places with his family: Odessa, Texas; Ventura, Bakersfield and Compton, California; and Midland, Texas.[4] In 1952, he volunteered for the successful presidential campaign of Republican candidate Dwight D. Eisenhower. That same year, his father won election to represent Connecticut in the United States Senate as a member of the Republican Party.[5]
With support from Mallon and Bush's uncle, George Herbert Walker Jr., Bush and John Overbey launched the Bush-Overbey Oil Development Company in 1951.[6] In 1953, he co-founded the Zapata Petroleum Corporation, an oil company that drilled in the Permian Basin in Texas.[7] In 1954, he was named president of the Zapata Offshore Company, a subsidiary which specialized in offshore drilling.[8] Shortly after the subsidiary became independent in 1959, Bush moved the company and his family from Midland to Houston.[9] There, he befriended James Baker, a prominent attorney who later became an important political ally.[10] Bush remained involved with Zapata until the mid-1960s, when he sold his stock in the company for approximately $1 million.[11]
In 1988, The Nation published an article alleging that Bush worked as an operative of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) during the 1960s; Bush denied this claim.[12]
