velt Range and Roosevelt Land after him.[33]
Roosevelt has also been portrayed in films and television series such as Brighty of the Grand Canyon, The Wind and the Lion, Rough Riders, My Friend Flicka,[34] and Law of the Plainsman. Robin Williams portrayed Roosevelt in the form of a wax mannequin that comes to life in Night at the Museum and its sequels.[35][36][37] Roosevelt is the leader of the American civilization in the video game Civilization VI.[38]
For 80 years, an equestrian statue of Roosevelt, sitting above a Native American and an African American, stood in front of New York's American Museum of Natural History. In 2022, after years of lobbying by activists, the statue was removed. Museum president Ellen V. Futter said the decision did not reflect a judgment about Roosevelt but the sculpture's "hierarchical composition".[39][40]
Audiovisual media
Roosevelt was one of the first presidents whose voice was recorded for posterity. Several of his recorded speeches survive.[41] A 1912 voice recording of The Right of the People to Rule,[42] which preserves Roosevelt's lower timbre ranges particularly well for its time, is available from the Michigan State University libraries. The audio clip sponsored by the Authentic History Center includes his defense[43] of the Progressive Party in 1912, wherein he proclaims it the "party of the people" – in contrast with the other major parties.
