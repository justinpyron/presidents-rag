ps, including tours of Europe in 1869 and 1870, and Egypt in 1872, shaped his cosmopolitan perspective.[6] Hiking with his family in the Alps in 1869, Roosevelt discovered the benefits of physical exertion to minimize his asthma and bolster his spirits.[7] Roosevelt began a heavy regimen of exercise. After being manhandled by older boys on the way to a camping trip, he found a boxing coach to train him.[8][9]
Education
Roosevelt was homeschooled. Biographer H. W. Brands wrote that, "The most obvious drawback...was uneven coverage of...various areas of...knowledge."[10] He was solid in geography and bright in history, biology, French, and German; however, he struggled in mathematics and the classical languages.
In September 1876, he entered Harvard College. His father instructed him to, "take care of your morals first, your health next, and finally your studies."[11] His father's sudden death in 1878 devastated Roosevelt.[12] He inherited $60,000 (equivalent to $1,894,345 in 2023), enough on which he could live comfortably for the rest of his life.[13]
His father, a devout Presbyterian, regularly led the family in prayers. Young Theodore emulated him by teaching Sunday School for more than three years at Christ Church in Cambridge. When the minister at Christ Church, which was an Episcopal church, eventually insisted he become an Episcopalian to continue teaching, Roosevelt declined, and began teaching a mission class in a poor section of Cambridge.[14]
